M.",NA,NA,NA,"Domestic pet dogs typically spend a large amount of time inside the home environment, including hours alone. An audio/food dispensing automated device (an artificial agent, hereafter agent) was evaluated for enrichment potential. The agent issued owner-spoken verbal cues to dogs, and food rewards for correct behaviour responses. The dogs' welfare during interaction was examined using Qualitative behaviour Assessment (QBA), and results were compared with quantitative behaviour measurements. QBA is a 'whole animal' measure, which describes and quantifies the emotionally expressive quality of an animal's demeanour in a specific context, using descriptive terms such as 'excited' or 'curious'. Adult pet domestic dogs (n = 17) were observed in two experimental conditions: 1) Agent; researcher and owner present (A+RO); 2) Agent; researcher and owner absent (A-RO). The agent was remotely triggered to call each dog by name and issue up to four repeated, randomised and previously trained verbal cues e.g., 'spin', 'roll', 'sit', 'up' (maximum 16 cues). In a baseline condition (Owner; researcher and agent present) (O+RA) the dog's owner replaced the agent's role. QBA using a fixed list of 20 descriptors was performed by three observers for each dog in each condition, using video recordings (51 clips) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) applied. QBA principal component 1 (PC1) was the same in all conditions, characterising dogs as ranging from 'attentive/interested/anticipating' to 'conflicted/apathetic', with the majority of dogs at the former end. QBA PC2 revealed variability in dogs' interactive styles, ranging from 'calm/concentrating' to 'aroused/excited/persistent' in agent conditions, and 'calm/wary' to 'excited/aroused' in baseline. Inter-observer agreement was high on all PCs (e.g., PC1 A+RO Kendall's W = 0.88; PC1 A-RO W = 0.83; PC1 O+RA W = 0.77). Quantitative continuous behaviour sampling revealed no significant differences in state behaviour between conditions; 'looking up' (p = 0.494); 'ears up' (p = 0.662); 'cued response behaviour (p = 0.630); these behaviour categories correlated significantly with QBA PC1 in each condition (average r = 0.800; r = 0.780; r = 0.793 respectively).& nbsp;Indicators of positive anticipation, sustained engagement, competence, and motivation were identified throughout testing and in all conditions. These findings suggest that positively reinforcing interactions with an agent or an owner are equally rewarding for dogs within the context of testing. This study is the first to assess welfare during interaction with an automated device and, using a novel application of QBA, suggests the overarching experience is pleasurable for dogs.","0     105595 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}","10.1016/j.applanim.2022.105595",NA,NA,"Dog;Artificial agent;Positive reinforcement;Pleasure;Positive;welfare;QBA;QUALITATIVE BEHAVIORAL-ASSESSMENT;COGNITIVE ENRICHMENT;TRAINING;METHODS;ANIMAL EMOTION;REWARD;CHALLENGE;INDICATOR;RESPONSES;SHELTER;HORSES;Dogs;Reinforcement (Psychology)",2022,"[Shaw, Nicky; Riley, Lisa M.] Univ Winchester, Fac Hlth & Wellbeing, Ctr Anim Welf, Sparkford Rd, Winchester, Hants, England.

In humans, the neurological background of variation in attachment and similar trait-like social behaviour has been described. It is known that certain sleep parameters are in association with an individual‚Äôs attachment-related traits. In the current study, we provide the first evidence that dogs‚Äô attachment towards their owner is also associated to dogs‚Äô sleep structure (the time they spend in the different sleep stages) as well as to their brain activity during sleep. Thus, as in humans, when dogs sleep in a novel environment (in the presence of their owners), differences in their attachment bond are reflected in their sleep EEG characteristics.AbstractAffective neuroscience studies have demonstrated the impact of social interactions on sleep quality. In humans, trait-like social behaviour such as attachment, are related to sleep brain activity patterns. Our aim was to investigate associations between companion dogs‚Äô spontaneous brain activity during sleep (in the presence of the owner) and their relevant behaviour in a task-free social context assessing their attachment towards the owner. In random order, each dog participated in a non-invasive sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) measurement and in the Strange Situation Test (SST) to assess their attachment behaviour We found that higher attachment scores were associated with more time spent in NREM sleep, lower NREM alpha power activity and lower NREM alpha‚Äìdelta anticorrelation. Our results reveal that, when dogs sleep in a novel environment in the company of their owners, differences in their attachment are reflected in their sleep EEG characteristics. This could be best explained by the different degree that owners could be used as a safe haven in an unfamiliar environment and during the unusual procedure of the first EEG measurement.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included"", ""l.c.blake""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: pass new rule",NA,NA,NA,"Dogs;Electroencephalography",2022,"Doctoral School of Biology, Institute of Biology, ELTE Eötvös Loránd University, 1117 Budapest, Hungary; vivien.reicher@gmail.com.

Decreasing stress during veterinary consultations is therefore a major concern, since animal welfare matters both for owners and veterinarians. Stress can be expressed through behaviour modifications; monitoring canine behaviour is thus one way to assess stress levels. We also know that the owner can affect dog behaviour in different ways. The aim of this study was therefore to assess the effect of the presence of owners on the behaviour of their dogs in veterinary consultations. We studied 25 dog-owner dyads at two standardised veterinary consultations, conducted at intervals of 5‚Äì7 weeks; the owner was present for the first consultation and absent for the second (O/NoO group, n = 12), or vice versa (NoO/O group, n = 13). A consultation consisted in three phases: exploration, examination, greeting. Dog behaviour were compared between the two conditions using a video recording.¬†Despite some limitations (e.g. no male owners, the exclusion of aggressive dogs, a limited sample size, minimally invasive veterinary examinations, restricted owner-dog interactions), our results showed that the presence or absence of the owner had no significant effect on the stress-related behaviour of the dog or the veterinarian‚Äôs ability to handle the animal during the examination phase (P > 0.05). Nevertheless, the behaviour of the dogs towards people was affected before, during, and after the veterinary examination. In the presence of their owner, dogs were more willing to enter the consultation room (P < 0.05), and they appeared more relaxed during the exploration phase (P < 0.01). During the examination, dogs looked in direction of their owner in both situations (owner present and behind the door, respectively; P < 0.001). These results suggest that allowing the owner to stay in the room during veterinary consultations is a better option for canine welfare.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included"", ""l.c.blake""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: pass new rule",NA,NA,NA,"Dogs;Referral and Consultation",2022,"Girault, C Ecole Nationale Vétérinaire de Toulouse, ENVT, 23 chemin des Capelles, BP 87614, 31076 Toulouse Cedex, France. , TOXALIM, Université de Toulouse, INRA, ENVT, 23 chemin des Capelles, BP 87614, 31076 Toulouse Cedex, France."

Here we assessed the effects of cooperative care training on heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), tympanic membrane temperature (TMT) and compliance (i.e., all steps of the examination completed) of dogs during a veterinary examination. A blinded controlled trial with 47 dogs (training group (TG): 26; control group (CG): 21) was carried out. Forty dogs completed the study (TG: 22, CG:18). Dogs and their owners took part in a standardized veterinary visit twice (visit interval: 140 ¬± 23 days). In between, the TG took part in cooperative care training (10 ¬± 2 group training sessions, additional training at home). Linear mixed models were calculated (fixed effects HR/HRV: group* visit* period, TMT: group* visit; random effect: dogID). Compliance (completed steps of exam) was analyzed using McNemar tests. HR/HRV was higher/lower during the veterinary examination compared to the waiting room (period: p &lt; 0.001), indicating that the examination was more stressful. No significant differences in HR/HRV regarding group*visit were found. TMT, taken at the end of each examination, resulted in a significant group*visit interaction (p = 0.008); stress appeared increased during visit 2 in the CG whereas in the TG a heterogeneous pattern, with 42% of dogs with reduced rightward bias, was observed. Compliance was lower in the TG during the second visit (p = 0.04). Trainer and owners claimed observable improvement of behaviour during training and a decrease in HR between visits correlated significantly with trainer perception of high training success (rs = ‚àí0.52, p = 0.049). Overall, transfer of trained skills to the veterinary examination performed by a team blinded to the group allocation was poor. TMT analyses and HR/HRV data within the training group, suggest that the training had differing effects on the dogs based on their previous tolerance of handling and their progress made during training. Further research how to optimize training programs, including desensitization and counterconditioning, and their outcomes is needed. ¬© 2022 The Authors","Export Date: 17 May 2022     CODEN: AABSE     Correspondence Address: Arhant, C.; Institute of Animal Welfare Science, Veterin√§rplatz 1, Austria; email: Christine.Arhant@vetmeduni.ac.at | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}","10.1016/j.applanim.2022.105615",NA,NA,"Animal welfare;Dogs/canine;Heart rate;Heart rate variability;Husbandry training;Low stress handling;Tympanic membrane temperature;behavioral response;canid;numerical model;physiology;Dogs;Pilot Projects",2022,"Institute of Animal Welfare Science, Vetmeduni Vienna, Austria     Department of Behavioural and Cognitive Biology, University of Vienna, Austria     Companion Animal Behaviour Group, Division of Animal Welfare, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Bern, Switzerland     Clinical Unit of Internal Medicine Small Animals, Vetmeduni Vienna, Austria"

The aim of the present study was to explore potential associations between social competence and the effect of intranasal oxytocin on the social behaviour of laboratory beagle dogs. We expected oxytocin treatment to have a more pronounced positive effect on dogs with lower baseline performance in a social test battery. Thirty-six adult dogs of both sexes received 32 IU intranasal oxytocin and physiological saline (placebo) treatment in a double-blind, cross-over design, with 17-20 days between the two sessions. Forty minutes after the treatment, dogs participated in a social test battery consisting of eight situations. The situations were carried out within one session and took 20-30 min to complete. Principal component analysis on the coded behaviour identified four components (Willingness to interact, Preference for social contact, Non-aversive response to nonsocial threat, and Non-aversive response to social threat). The subjects' behaviour during the placebo condition was used to assess their baseline performance. We found that oxytocin treatment had a differential effect on the behaviour depending on the baseline performance of the individuals in all components, but only two treatment √ó baseline performance interactions remained significant in a less sensitive analysis. In accordance with our hypothesis, oxytocin administration increased dogs' contact seeking and affiliative behaviour toward humans but only for those with low baseline performance. Dogs with low baseline performance also showed significantly more positive (friendly) reactions to social threat after oxytocin administration than after placebo, while for dogs with high baseline performance, oxytocin administration led to a more negative (fearful) reaction. These results indicate that similar to those on humans, the effects of oxytocin on dogs' social behaviour are not universally positive but are constrained by individual characteristics and the context. Nevertheless, oxytocin administration has the potential to improve the social behaviour of laboratory beagle dogs that are socially less proficient when interacting with humans, which could have both applied and animal welfare implications.","785805 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included"", ""l.c.blake""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: pass new rule",NA,NA,NA,"Dogs;MSH Release-Inhibiting Hormone;Social Behavior;Oxytocin",2022,"Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychology, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Budapest, Hungary.

Therefore, we hypothesized that dogs show overimitation as a result of affiliation.

Although our overall results were not significant, our data might suggest that, on average, the dogs who overimitated might also show more referential and affiliative behaviour towards the owner (like gazing, synchronization and greeting) than dogs who showed less or no copying of the irrelevant action. Possible reasons for these negative findings are discussed, together with the implications for dog owners.AbstractOverimitation, the copying of causally irrelevant or non-functional actions, is well-known from humans but completely absent in other primates. Recent studies from our lab have provided evidence for overimitation in canines. Previously, we found that half of tested pet dogs copied their human caregiver‚Äôs irrelevant action, while only few did so when the action was demonstrated by an unfamiliar experimenter. Therefore, we hypothesized that dogs show overimitation as a result of socio-motivational grounds. To test this more specifically, here we investigated how the relationship with the caregiver influenced the eagerness to overimitate. Given the high variability in the tendency to overimitate their caregiver, we hypothesized that not only familiarity but also relationship quality influences whether dogs faithfully copy their caregiver. For this purpose, on the one hand we measured the overimitation tendency (with the same test as in the two studies before) and on the other hand the relationship quality between the dogs and their caregivers. Although we found no significant correlation between the two test results, our data might suggest that, on average, dogs who overimitated seemed to show more referential and affiliative behaviour towards the owner than dogs who showed less or no copying of the irrelevant action.

In Namibia, LGDs are used in cheetah conservation to prevent depredation of stock and reduce retaliatory killings. However, behaviour problems in the dogs, such as chasing wildlife and harassing livestock, exist leading to poor dog performance and farmer dissatisfaction. In most other types of working dogs, behaviour tests for suitability are reported and/or validated within the scientific literature. To date this has not been done for LGDs. In this paper, we design a composite behaviour test and a questionnaire to rate the dogs‚Äô effectiveness as an LGD. This test was used on 14 LGDs, 7 of which were operational and 7 of which were being used as breeding stock. In total, 16 behaviour variables were measured.

Dogs scoring higher for ‚ÄúPlayfulness‚Äù were more likely to be reported to harass stock, and dogs that chased a moving object under experimental conditions were generally rated higher for tendency to chase predator wildlife when working.

The experimental manipulation served to prime the dogs with positive and negative affect in the form of social interactions. Dogs (N = 20) participated in both a negative and a positive social interaction with an unfamiliar male experimenter. Having received pretreatment with different social stimuli, subjects were observed in an instrumental task with an unfamiliar female experimenter requesting an out-of-reach object. The analysis of the dogs‚Äô tendency to engage in the task revealed that although the type of pretreatment did not influence whether they retrieved the cued object or not, the social interactions had a facilitatory effect on other, more subtle aspects of their behaviour The positive interaction resulted in longer duration of looking time at the experimenter; shorter latency of moving upon release and of approaching the experimenter. The priming effects of the negative social interaction manifested in longer duration of looking time at the owner after release while gazing more at the target object during the first trial. These behaviour together with the finding that dogs were more hesitant to approach the experimenter after the negative social interaction, may indicate that a negative emotional stimulation (involving the owner‚Äôs and the experimenter‚Äôs unresponsive behaviour separation and a threatening stranger) causes a temporary disruption in the dog-owner bond, motivating the dog to repair it afterwards. These findings suggest that the valence attributed to the social interaction during pretreatment has differential effects on dogs‚Äô subsequent behaviour Possible parallels with and differences from human behaviour are discussed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,NA,NA,"Dogs",2021,"Galambos, Ágoston Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychology, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Budapest, Hungary. , Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychology, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Budapest, Hungary."

Shelter dogs have usually experienced a life involving poor social interactions with humans. Thus, we aimed to investigate the behaviour responses of shelter dogs (SDs) and companion dogs (CDs) during the training of two vocal cues (""sit"", ""paw""), as well as the possible associations between their responses and the behaviour of trainers. We studied 15 SDs and 15 CDs in up to eight five-minute training sessions. Dogs' and trainers' behaviour were recorded and analyzed (through GLM, GLMM, correlation and Mann-Whitney tests). Shelter dogs responded to more cues per session, with shorter latencies and fewer repetitions of cues. Moreover, SDs spent more time wagging their tails. Dogs' sex and trainers' behaviour were also associated with differences in dogs' responses. The use of a reproachful tone of voice was associated with a greater number of cues responded to, shorter latencies, and fewer repetitions of cues. However, this type voice/discourse was also linked to a greater exhibition of non-training behaviour (e.g., exploring the room or jumping on the trainer), and to dogs spending less time next to the trainer and wagging their tails. On the other hand, the use of a neutral tone of voice and laughter, besides being linked to performance, was also associated with longer durations of tail wagging. Furthermore, the duration of the trainers' orientation to dogs was correlated with the orientation of the dogs to the trainers. Our data suggest that, even when having experienced social deprivation from humans, SDs' capacities to learn vocal cues were preserved, possibly due to ontogenic homeostasis processes. Shelter dogs' greater interest in the sessions may be also credited to their socially-deprived routine. Our outcomes also point to an association between friendly interactions during training and dog performance and excitement, which suggests that such interactions may have the potential to improve SD welfare.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,NA,NA,"Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Dogs;Cues",2021,"Department of Biological Sciences, Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte 30535-901, Brazil."

Therefore, our main aim was to test the hypothesis that an emotionally charged (negative, positive, or neutral) interaction with the demonstrator of a ‚ÄúV‚Äù detour task prior to testing would affect subjects‚Äô performance, by: (i) changing the value of the information provided by the demonstrator or (ii) changing the valence of the learning environment. Our experimental design consisted of three phases: pre-test (subjects were allowed to solve the task alone); emotional display (dogs watched the unfamiliar human behaviour in either a positive, negative or neutral way towards their owner); test (demonstrator showed the task and subjects were allowed to move freely). Only dogs that failed in pre-test were considered for analysis (n = 46). We analyzed four dependent variables: success, time to solve the task, latency to reach the fence and matching the side of demonstration. For each, we used four models (GEEs and GLMMs) to investigate the effect of (1) demographic factors; (2) experimental design factors (including emotional group); (3) behaviour of the dog; and (4) side chosen and matching. All models took into account all trials (random effect included) and the first trials only. Our findings corroborate previous studies of social learning, but present no evidence to sustain our hypothesis.

This study investigated whether high arousal/excited departures and greetings with a dog may lead to the development of increased frequency of separation-related behaviour in newly adopted dogs. In experiment 1, we exposed two groups of dogs to a series of either high or low arousal human experimenter interactions. We hypothesized there would be an increase in activity, vocalizations, and time in proximity to door for the dogs in the high arousal condition compared with the low arousal condition, when left alone, and that these behaviour would increase across 10 sessions. Our results did not show this, indicating high arousal departures and arrivals may not play a role in the development of increased separation-related behaviour In experiment 2, we used a survey to ask owners of dogs with, and without, canine separation anxiety about their arousal levels during arrivals and departures at home with their pet dog. We hypothesized dogs with reported canine separation anxiety would have been exposed to higher arousal levels during departures and arrivals. Our results showed a small difference between the groups, in the opposite direction of our hypothesis, where the dogs with reported canine separation anxiety were exposed to slightly lower arousal levels than dogs without, but the difference was small. From both experiment 1 and 2, our results indicate that high excitement and playful levels of owners during departures and arrivals is not associated with the development of increased separation-related behaviour in newly adopted dogs.

Overall, the presence of a person, combined with auditory enrichment, induced greater interest compared to just an audio stimulation in both shelter dogs and cats. However, some animals showed signs of frustration likely due to not being able to physically interact with the human. Given that dogs that exhibit calmness and cats that scratch the door in the presence of humans and try to attract human attention are more likely to be adopted, auditory enrichment combined with human presence promotes behaviour that may consequentially increase adoption rate.AbstractReading books to shelter animals combining auditory enrichment with human presence is increasingly used although its effects on animal welfare have not yet been investigated.

One of the factors associated with this variance is the dogs' social rank, but no studies so far investigated the role of dog-owner relationship in this matter. We investigated how this relationship, with a focus on behaviour might affect social learning from the owner and strangers. We used a questionnaire and two behaviour tests to assess the dogs' attitude towards their owner, and tested the dogs in a well-established detour reaching task without demonstration (individual problem-solving), with owner demonstration and with experimenter (unfamiliar human) demonstration. In general, dogs detoured faster if a human demonstrated the task. In case of unfamiliar demonstrator, dogs that scored higher on aggression and assertiveness-related traits learned better from the demonstrator, but also dogs who had low scores on possessiveness performed better in this condition. Traits relating to attention problems and activity did not affect performance, but these ""overactive"" dogs looked back at the owner less frequently during the individual problem-solving scenario. Our results indicate that dog-human relationship may have a complex association with various aspects of social interactions between the two species, including problem behaviour and social learning, too. We investigated how dog-owner relationship-with a focus on possible behaviour problems-might associate with the individual variability in dogs' social learning performance. Dog owners first completed a questionnaire about their relationship with their dogs (N = 98). Then, dogs were tested in a detour test: a control group without demonstration, a group where the owner demonstrated the task and another group where the experimenter demonstrated the task. Finally, the dogs participated in two behaviour tests measuring their tractability and possessiveness. The two principal components from the questionnaire (called ""overactive"" and ""irritable"") did not show significant association with dogs' detour performance in the control group. ""irritable"" dogs performed better in the unfamiliar demonstrator group. These more persistent, goal-oriented dogs also looked back less at their owners during the detour. In the individual problem-solving context, the factor ""overactive"" had a similar effect on looking back at the owner, suggesting that the items of this component primarily are not connected to the dog-human relationship. Our results indicate that dog-human relationship has an integral role in the complex social behaviour of dogs, which warrants for the need of further empirical testing of the associations between social dynamics in dogs and their relationship with humans, including problem behaviour","1     961 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included"", ""l.c.blake""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: fails new rule",NA,NA,NA,"dog;social learning;detour test;dog&#8211;owner relationship;Dogs",2021,"[Pongracz, Peter; Rieger, Gabriella; Vekony, Kata] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Ethol, H-1053 Budapest, Hungary.

For companion dogs, training helps preventing or managing dog behaviour problems-the most frequently cited reason for relinquishing and euthanasia, and it promotes successful dog-human relationships and thus maximizes benefits humans derive from bonding with dogs. For working dogs, training is crucial for them to successfully accomplish their jobs. Dog training methods range widely from those using predominantly aversive stimuli (aversive methods), to those combining aversive and rewarding stimuli (mixed methods) and those focusing on the use of rewards (reward methods). The use of aversive stimuli in training is highly controversial and several veterinary and animal protection organizations have recommended a ban on pinch collars, e-collars and other techniques that induce fear or pain in dogs, on the grounds that such methods compromise dog welfare. At the same time, training methods based on the use of rewards are claimed to be more humane and equally or more effective than aversive or mixed methods. This important discussion, however, has not always been based in solid scientific evidence. Although there is growing scientific evidence that training with aversive stimuli has a negative impact on dog welfare, the scientific literature on the efficacy and efficiency of the different methodologies is scarce and inconsistent. Hence, the goal of the current study is to investigate the efficacy and efficiency of different dog training methods. To that end, we will apply different dog training methods in a population of working dogs and evaluate the outcome after a period of training. The use of working dogs will allow for a rigorous experimental design and control, with randomization of treatments. Military (n = 10) and police (n = 20) dogs will be pseudo-randomly allocated to two groups. One group will be trained to perform a set of tasks (food refusal, interrupted recall, dumbbell retrieval and placing items in a basket) using reward methods and the other group will be trained for the same tasks using mixed methods. Later, the dogs will perform a standardized test where they will be required to perform the trained behaviour The reliability of the behaviour and the time taken to learn them will be assessed in order to evaluate the efficacy and efficiency, respectively, of the different training methods.

Social isolation is likely one component of the environment that contributes to poor welfare but spending time out of the kennel with a person has been shown to temporarily ameliorate that stress. In this study, 164 shelter-living dogs at four animal shelters across the United States were taken on two-and-half-hour outings with a person and physiological measures of stress and physical activity captured by accelerometer devices were compared before, during, and after this short-term outing. We found that dogs‚Äô stress was higher when they were away on these field trips and their activity changed, including less time spent in low activity and more time in higher activity. While measures of physiology and activity were found to return to pre-field trip levels the following day, these results suggest that outings of this duration do not provide the same reduction in stress as previously shown with temporary fostering. Nevertheless, short-term outings may provide shelter dogs with greater adoption visibility and assist in foster recruitment and, thus, should be further explored.AbstractSocial isolation likely contributes to reduced welfare for shelter-living dogs. Several studies have established that time out of the kennel with a person can improve dogs‚Äô behaviour and reduce physiological measures of stress. This study assessed the effects of two-and-a-half-hour outings on the urinary cortisol levels and activity of dogs as they awaited adoption at four animal shelters. Dogs‚Äô urine was collected before and after outings for cortisol:creatinine analysis, and accelerometer devices were used to measure dogs‚Äô physical activity. In total, 164 dogs participated in this study, with 793 cortisol values and 3750 activity measures used in the statistical analyses. We found that dogs‚Äô cortisol:creatinine ratios were significantly higher during the afternoon of the intervention but returned to pre-field trip levels the following day. Dogs‚Äô minutes of low activity were significantly reduced, and high activity significantly increased during the outing. Although dogs‚Äô cortisol and activity returned to baseline after the intervention, our findings suggest that short-term outings do not confer the same stress reduction benefits as previously shown with temporary fostering. Nevertheless, it is possible that these types of outing programs are beneficial to adoptions by increasing the visibility of dogs and should be further investigated to elucidate these effects.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,NA,NA,"Dogs",2021,"Department of Psychology, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85281, USA; rgilchri@asu.edu (R.J.G.); eblade@asu.edu (E.M.B.); cwynne1@asu.edu (C.D.L.W.) .

The role of canine personality on this predisposition is unknown. This study used a test where dogs encountered an unsolvable problem. The aim of the study was to understand whether dog personalities could predict their tendency to look at the owner, approach and engage with the task, and show distress during the task. We also compared dogs with life experience in Animal Assistance Interventions and dogs with no work, training, or sport experience. The results indicate that the dogs with a personality more sensitive to uncertain situations looked at the owner more and engaged less often with the task, suggesting they were expecting directions from the owner. Dogs with a personality more sensitive to obtaining rewards and avoiding punishment looked at the owner less often. Dogs with a high tendency to avoid punishment also abandoned and returned more often to the task, possibly as a sign of frustration. Finally, Animal-Assisted Intervention dogs looked more at the owner and had fewer task orientations, confirming the enhancing effect on looking. As personality differences reflect genetic predispositions, it is very important to know the role of personality on cognitive traits that are important to dogs that work and collaborate with humans.AbstractDogs are biologically predisposed to communicate with humans in cooperative contexts. They show individual differences in dog‚Äìhuman communication and inhibition, potentially enhanced by life experience, e.g., Animal-Assisted Interventions. This study aimed to investigate whether dogs‚Äô personality, defined by biologically meaningful neural circuits described in the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory of Personality (RST), predicted dogs‚Äô communication, task orientation, emotional state, and approach of an unsolvable task. We also investigated the differences between dogs experienced in Animal-Assisted Interventions (AAI) and inexperienced dogs. The results indicated that a high sensitivity to the RST personality trait related to managing uncertainty (behaviour Inhibition System, BIS) predicted fewer task orientations but increased referential and non-referential looking, which we interpreted as a way to obtain directions from the owner. Conversely, a high sensitivity to the traits reflecting tendencies to approach rewards (behaviour Approach System, BAS) and avoid punishment (Fight‚ÄìFlight‚ÄìFreeze System, FFFS) predicted lower looking. High sensitivity to the FFFS also predicted more frequent task orientations, which we interpreted as frustration. Finally, the dogs in the AAI program looked more at their owner and were less oriented towards the task. These results provide empirical evidence of individual differences tied to the psychobiological personality traits in canine cognitive skills. Understanding such cognitive profiles may have an enormous impact on activities that rely upon dog‚Äìhuman collaborative interaction.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,NA,NA,"Dogs;Animals;Animal Shells",2021,"Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Milan, Via dell’Università 6, 26900 Lodi, Italy; patrizia.piotti1@unimi.it (P.P.); federica.pirrone@unimi.it (F.P.).

This practice is known to be a possible source of complication in dog keeping. behaviour and veterinarians are frequently consulted due to excessive vocalisations, destructive behaviour and house-soiling of dogs left alone by their owners. These observations are thought to be symptoms of a disorder which most authors refer to as separation anxiety or separation related behaviour Little is known about dogs, which showed mostly inconspicuous behaviour during separation, and possible effects of the presence of conspecifics in multi-dog households, which may help coping with separation. Therefore, we videotaped 32 dogs in single-dog and 45 dogs in multi-dog households left home alone as part of their usual routine. We performed a continuous sampling of location, posture, vocalization, and various other behaviour Calculating and comparing percentages of observation time we tested possible effects of familiar conspecifics, and investigated the effects of sex and neuter status, variables that are discussed to have an influence on the onset of separation anxiety. In general, our dogs showed low physical activity as well as a low vocal activity, independent from the time being alone. Male dogs in multi-dog households showed a significantly higher vocal activity. A further sex related difference was that male dogs were more prone to stay at the exit-door. This bias may be due to sex-specific motivations but seems to get stronger with increasing duration of separation. Dogs in multi-dog households showed a significant higher activity (single dog: 15.3 ¬± 14.3, multi-dog: 27.5 ¬± 26.1 mean ¬± SD). The major difference in activity was found in the first hour of being alone and interactions with other pets played only a marginal role even in multi-dog households (0.24 ¬± 0.6).

In the present study, we conducted two experiments in which pet dogs were tested in an object-manipulation task in the presence of the owner and of a stranger, varying how the human partner would behaviour (i.e. remaining silent or encouraging the dog, Experiment 1), and when alone (Experiment 2). Further, to gain a better insight into the mechanisms behind a potential owner-stranger differentiation, we investigated the effect of dogs‚Äô previous life history (i.e. having lived in a shelter or having lived in the same household since puppyhood). Overall, we found that strangers do not provide a secure base effect and that former shelter dogs show a stronger owner-stranger differentiation than other family dogs. As former shelter dogs show more behaviour signs correlated with anxiety towards the novel environment and the stranger, we concluded that having been re-homed does not necessarily affect the likelihood of forming a secure bond with the new owner but might have an impact on how dogs interact with novel stimuli, including unfamiliar humans. These results confirm the owner‚Äôs unique role in providing security to their dogs and have practical implications for the bond formation in pet dogs with a past in a shelter.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included"", ""l.c.blake""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: pass new rule",NA,NA,NA,"Dogs;Problem Solving",2021,"Clever Dog Lab, Comparative Cognition, Messerli Research Institute, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Medical University of Vienna, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.

Free-ranging dogs are one of the successful urban-adapted species that interact with humans regularly, which, in turn, influences their behaviour properties. In this study, we tested 600 adult dogs from 60 sites across India, categorized as high, low, and intermediate human flux zones, to understand their degree of sociability toward an unfamiliar human.

Fear in kenneled dogs is a serious behaviour welfare concern as it may lead to both acute and chronic stress. Novel social and non-social stimuli have been shown to elicit behaviour associated with fear in animals. New knowledge on the levels of fear in dogs from CBKs could be used to further refine protocols intended for assessment of welfare in CBKs and to improve breeders‚Äô management practices. The aim of this study, therefore, was to evaluate how dogs from CBKs reacted to social (i.e., a person approaching) and non-social (i.e., a traffic cone and a dog statue) stimuli, and to perform a preliminary evaluation of how these responses might be used as indicators of dogs‚Äô overall socialization levels in kennels. Results revealed that dogs had primarily mildly fearful responses to the stimuli presented. These findings are encouraging as extreme fearful reactions were rarely recorded. Nevertheless, there is a clear margin for commercial breeders to improve the socialization protocols in their kennels to better incorporate both social and non-social stimuli.AbstractUnderstanding the behaviour welfare of dogs in commercial breeding kennels (CBKs) is important for improving breeders‚Äô management practices as well as dog welfare. In the current study, breeding dogs from CBKs were exposed to novel stimuli to evaluate their behaviour responses, with emphasis on indicators of fear. Subjects were presented with a standard stranger-approach test, a traffic cone, and a realistic dog statue. Sixty dogs were exposed to the three stimuli and behaviour responses were scored using an ethogram developed for this study. Dogs spent significantly more time investigating the environment, staying further away from the stimulus, and they took longer to approach and investigate when presented with the cone than with the dog statue or stranger (p< 0.01). These findings suggest that the cone elicited more fear-related behaviour than the dog statue and stranger. Given these results, in addition to socializing their dogs to unfamiliar people and other dogs within their kennels, commercial breeders should be encouraged to increase the exposure of their dogs to more diverse novel stimuli to reduce non-social fear and support the welfare of dogs while they reside in the kennel and when they transition to new homes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included"", ""l.c.blake""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: pass new rule",NA,NA,NA,"Dogs;Breeding",2021,"Department of Comparative Pathobiology, Purdue University, 725 Harrison Street, West Lafayette, IN 47906, USA"

B.",NA,NA,NA,"Simple Summary Cognitive aging in dogs has attracted interest due to their utility as an animal model for human aging and their need for veterinary care. The latter in particular would benefit substantially from standardized tests for fast and comfortable administration, which would reduce time and financial costs for both owners and practitioners. Here, we examine a battery of tests (the mini mental test, MMT) selected and adapted toward this end in a sample of 20 young (1-5y) and 26 old (10-15y) dogs. Each behaviour test was evaluated for its ability to discriminate between dogs based on their age category. Older dogs displayed less social interest, performed worse in a place-memory test, and seemed both less interested in and less fearful of a novel, moving object, aligning with previous findings and thus confirming the MMT's external validity. The older dogs were also less excitable, assessed by a dog personality questionnaire. Based on these results, for future studies comparing the behaviour of young adult and old dogs, we suggest four feasible subtests (greeting, problem box, memory, novel object) that can be conducted outdoors, without complex devices, in a short time (< than 15 min), and evaluated on the spot. To determine which performance levels are within the normal range for old dogs, larger samples grouped by breed and age will need to be tested in future studies. Over the last few years, several efforts have been undertaken to characterize the aging process in dogs. In the present study, we evaluate a short protocol measuring dogs' cognitive, social, and physical capacities. Our aim was to develop a feasible test battery, with minimal pre-training requirements, no complex devices, and which is set outdoors (i.e., a specific testing room is not needed). As ageing in dogs is usually associated with a decrease in activity, we also assessed the personality trait activity/excitability with a dog personality questionnaire. Four subtests proved sensitive to the dogs' age. In particular, old dogs displayed less approaching and following behaviour toward an unknown but friendly human, showed both less avoidance and interest toward a novel object, looked less at the owner when faced with an unsolvable problem, and performed worse on the short-term memory task. Previous test procedures for investigating age-related changes involve expensive and/or complicated devices and extensive pre-training. The main advantage of the proposed battery is to reduce costs and efforts in veterinary assessments. Further tests in same-breed, large samples and between dogs with mild and severe cognitive impairments will be needed in order to further validate the battery.","3     1222 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}","10.3390/ani10071222",NA,NA,"ageing;cognition;social behavior;personality;excitability;dog;MODEL;Dogs",2020,"[Kubinyi, Eniko; Iotchev, Ivaylo B.] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Ethol, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary.

Many dog owners anecdotally report that dogs comfort them by making visual and/or physical contact when they cry or help them when they are sick. These behaviour provide a good way to assess the capacity for empathy and its physiological correlates in dogs. This study is a replication and extension of Custance and Mayer (2012). We examined whether using laughing as an alternative stimulus to humming produced similar responses to crying. Dogs were tested in their homes while a stranger and owner pretended to cry, laugh, and while the owner and stranger were talking. During each counterbalanced condition, the dog was observed for person-oriented behaviour and simultaneously had their heart rate variability measured. Like Custance and Mayer, dogs showed more behaviour directed toward the person crying, whether the owner or the stranger, than during baseline or laughing conditions. We did not find an effect of laughing on person-oriented behaviour suggesting that dogs respond to the crying uniquely and not as a novel stimulus. In the condition when the stranger was crying, dogs that showed higher stress responses, as indicated by lower heart rate variability, were most likely to show person-oriented behaviour toward the stranger. This suggests that dogs that experience more distress, through emotional contagion, are more likely to show person-oriented behaviour toward the distressed stranger, indicating a possible mechanism for empathy-like behaviour (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)Public Significance Statement‚ÄîThis study found that dogs responded by contacting individuals who were crying but not those who were laughing or talking. This study further supports cross-species empathy-like behaviour and the unique emotional nature of human-dog interactions.

The present study aimed to investigate how dogs' behaviour is affected by their owners' visual attention while performing a repetitive task (bringing an object back to an unfamiliar experimenter while the owner waited passively). We assumed that if dogs are susceptible to the audience effect, their task persistence and task performance would vary according to their owners' attentiveness. A group of adult pet dogs (N = 27) were repeatedly presented with an object retrieval task by the experimenter (N = 20 trials) while owners either ignored their dogs (Inattentive Owner condition) or paid attention to their dogs' actions (Attentive Owner condition). behaviour observations were complemented with the owner's reports of their relationships with their dogs (assessed by means of an owner-pet attachment questionnaire) and dogs' spectral EEG sleep profile (recorded during 3-h-long daytime sleep). Although dogs, independently of their owners' attentional state, were generally willing to comply with the fetching task, they were faster to approach the toy object and gazed significantly longer at their owners when he/she was paying attention. This finding is reminiscent of peer influence observed in humans. Further, characteristics of relationship insecurity (relationship anxiety and avoidance) were associated with dogs' task persistence and performance. Dogs of owners with higher relationship anxiety tended to approach the toy object less frequently, and dogs of owners with higher relationship avoidance and anxiety were more hesitant to approach the toy object. We also found that dogs' individual susceptibilities to the audience effect is related to EEG spectral power of both REM and non-REM sleep as well as in pre-sleep (drowsiness) in a trait-like manner. These results, in line with previous findings, support the notion that dogs have a somewhat human-like susceptibility to the audience effect, a trait which might be linked to more complex mechanisms, such as self-presentation or reputation management, helping the two species to become effective social partners.","1461 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,NA,NA,"Dogs",2020,"Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychology, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Budapest, Hungary."

Based on coding 22.9 hours of 135 videos, comparisons of the frequency and duration of dog behaviour (e.g., postural state, oral behaviour before and during interactions with students revealed an increase in the frequency of lip licking (Mbefore = 1.23, Mduring = 1.76, Z = ‚Äì4.651, p &lt; 0.001, r = 0.283) and yawning (Mbefore = 0.08, Mduring = 0.16, Z = ‚Äì3.051, p = 0.002, r = 0.186) in dogs. Correlations between dog and student greeting behaviour (e.g., posture, petting behaviour revealed a positive correlation between the frequency of lip licking and mutual greetings between students and dogs (r(133) = 0.283, p = 0.001).

The absence of severe stress behaviour and continued presence of sustained social approach behaviour suggests that the dogs were not severely stressed during interactions.

In this study, we examined attachment relationships between dogs living in animal shelters and foster homes and their temporary caregivers-shelter volunteers or foster volunteers, respectively. We also examined these results in relation to previously published data from pet dogs in order to contextualize our findings. Our findings indicate that the percentage of securely attached shelter dogs was significantly lower than that previously observed in scientific studies of the pet dog population. No differences were found between proportions of securely attached foster dogs and prior research with pets. We did not find significant differences between foster and shelter dogs in terms of attachment style proportions. We also found evidence of disinhibited attachment, which is associated with a lack of appropriate social responses with unfamiliar and familiar individuals in foster and shelter dogs. This is the first study to apply attachment theory to foster and shelter settings.AbstractThis study aimed to characterize attachment relationships between humans and dogs living in animal shelters or foster homes, and to contextualize these relationships in the broader canine attachment literature. In this study, 21 pairs of foster dogs and foster volunteers and 31 pairs of shelter dogs and shelter volunteers participated. Each volunteer‚Äìdog dyad participated in a secure base test and a paired attachment test. All volunteers completed the Lexington Attachment to Pets Scale (LAPS), a survey designed to measure strength of attachment bonds as reported by humans. Although no significant differences were present in terms of proportions of insecure and secure attachments between foster and shelter populations, proportions in the shelter population were significantly lower (p< 0.05) than the proportions of attachment styles that would be expected in a population of pet dogs based on the published literature on pet dog attachment styles. Additionally, findings are presented in relation to data from a paired attachment test that demonstrate foster and shelter dogs spend more time in proximity to humans when the human is actively attending to the dog and encouraging interaction, as would be expected based on previous studies. We also present findings related to the presence of disinhibited attachment (previously reported in children who spent a significant portion of time living in institutionalized settings) which is characterized by a lack of preferential proximity seeking with a familiar caregiver and excessive friendliness towards strangers in foster and shelter dogs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,NA,NA,"Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Dogs",2020,"Department of Animal & Rangeland Sciences, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97331, USA;"

Here we describe the first study to simultaneously collect objective DAD behaviour data from CCTV footage and concurrent owner glucose levels via a Flash Glucose Monitoring System (FGMS). Using a pre-defined behaviour ethogram, both trained and non-trained canine behaviour were recorded. Given that dogs are trained to display attention-seeking behaviour when their owners experience fluctuations outside of normal blood glucose levels, we would expect differences in DAD behaviour during periods when owner glucose levels transition from euglycaemia to hyperglycaemic (high) or hypoglycaemic (low) levels, as compared to periods when owners stay within target-range.A FreeStyle Libre FGMS was given to nine owners of accredited DADs from a single training establishment. behaviour data were collected using CCTV in the participants' home, or place of work, for between five and 14 days (mean‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ12.2 days). For each person, between 19 and 29 (mean‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ22.5) one-hour periods were selected that captured approximately equal instances of owner glucose levels transitioning from in-range to hypoglycaemia, in-range to hyperglycaemia, or remaining within target-range. Two researchers coded footage without knowledge of the owner's glucose levels. Variables recorded included the DAD's Activity, Attentional State, Proximity to Owner, Attention-seeking, and potential Stress-related behaviour were significant differences between individual dogs' behaviour during in-range periods. When samples captured a transition to out-of-range glucose levels (hypo- or hyperglycaemia), the distribution of several behaviour among dogs in the cohort differed significantly from their distributions during in-range samples (p‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.01 for Conover Tests in Playing with Owner, Jump Up, Sniff Owner, Bark, Paw Owner, and Lick Owner), but consistent increases or decreases in the rate of any behaviour were not detected across the cohort. In individual dogs, we found distinctive behaviour changes during periods when their owner's glucose transitioned to out-of-range, as compared to when they remained in-range. Each DAD showed significant changes in the variance of at least one trained attention-seeking behaviour with several dogs also showing changes in non-trained behaviour such as Change of State, Playing with Owner and potential stress-related behaviour (Yawning and Lip-Licking). This is the first study to objectively show that DADs differ in their behaviour during periods of owner glucose fluctuation and further highlights the individuality of responses. Understanding this variation, and factors affecting it, is fundamental to optimising DAD performance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,NA,NA,"Dogs",2020,"Wilson, Clara H Animal Welfare and Behaviour Group, Bristol Veterinary School, Langford House, Langford, Bristol, BS40 5DU, UK. , Animal Welfare and Behaviour Group, Bristol Veterinary School, Langford House, Langford, Bristol, BS40 5DU, UK."

In two experiments, we investigated whether dogs would rescue their owners when the person was trapped inside a wooden box and emitted clear signs of stress. The performance of these dogs was compared against that of a control group in which the owners remained calm while trapped. In addition, to assess if training modulated this behaviour we tested a group of dogs from the military trained in search and rescue tasks (Experiment 1). Results showed that dogs opened the box more frequently when the owner pretended to be stressed than when calm. Training shortened latencies to open the door but not the frequency of the behaviour In Experiment 2, we investigated if emotional contagion could be a possible mechanism underlying dogs' rescue responses by measuring dogs‚Äô behaviour heart rate, and saliva cortisol level in the stressed and calm conditions, and also controlled for obedience by having the calm owners call their pets while trapped. We replicated the findings of Experiment 1 as more dogs opened the door in the stressed owner condition than in the calm condition. In addition, we observed an increase in heart rate across trials in the stressed condition and a decrease across trials in the calm condition, but no differences in cortisol levels or stress-related behaviour between conditions. In brief, we found evidence that approximately half of the dogs without previous training showed spontaneous rescue behaviour directed to their owners. Neither was this behaviour motivated by obedience nor by the motivation to re-establish social contact with the owner.

Fourteen 2 months old puppies were tested in the Ainsworth Strange Situation test in which the role of the human caregiver was played by the person with whom puppies had interacted more in their first weeks of life, i.e. their breeder. As expected, puppies displayed more protest at separation (whining, behaviour against the door, close to the door etc.) when involuntarily separated from the breeder. They also increased the seeking of proximity after separation, but they did not show a clear preference for the breeder over a human stranger. The duration of exploration, play and resting seem to be related to the order of episodes more than to a secure base effect. The findings of this preliminary study do not fully support the hypothesis that dogs establish an attachment bond towards their human caregivers since puppies, provided that they are raised by their mother.

Ninety-two companion dogs were recruited from three reward-based schools (Group Reward, n = 42), and from four aversive-based schools, two using low proportions of aversive-based methods (Group Mixed, n = 22) and two using high proportions of aversive-based methods (Group Aversive, n = 28). For evaluating welfare during training, dogs were video recorded for three sessions and six saliva samples were collected, three at home (baseline levels) and three after training (post-training levels). Video recordings were used to examine the frequency of stress-related behaviour (e.g., lip lick, yawn) and the overall behaviour state of the dog (e.g., tense, relaxed), and saliva samples were analyzed for cortisol concentration. For evaluating welfare outside the training context, dogs participated in a cognitive bias task. Results showed that dogs from Group Aversive displayed more stress-related behaviour were more frequently in tense and low behaviour states and panted more during training, and exhibited higher post-training increases in cortisol levels than dogs from Group Reward. Additionally, dogs from Group Aversive were more ‚Äòpessimistic‚Äô in the cognitive bias task than dogs from Group Reward. Dogs from Group Mixed displayed more stress-related behaviour were more frequently in tense states and panted more during training than dogs from Group Reward. Finally, although Groups Mixed and Aversive did not differ in their performance in the cognitive bias task nor in cortisol levels, the former displayed more stress-related behaviour and was more frequently in tense and low behaviour states.

How dog-directed parenting styles express in specific owner-dog interactions is presently unknown. However, such knowledge can help to advise dog owners on appropriate parenting of their dog. Child-directed parenting is regarded appropriate when it is demanding for socially adaptive behaviour as well as responsive to the child‚Äôs needs. This combination of high demandingness and responsiveness is known as authoritative parenting, which in dog-directed parenting manifests in two ways. Teaching the dog socially adaptive behaviour is key to the authoritative-training style (AUT) and being responsive to the dog‚Äôs perceived needs and emotions is key to the authoritative-intrinsic style (AUI). A third dog-directed parenting style, the authoritarian-correction style (AUC), of high demandingness and low responsiveness focusses on correcting the dog‚Äôs undesired behaviour We determined these three dog-directed parenting styles by an online questionnaire and tested the styles for associations with owner and dog behaviour The behaviour were scored as the owner-dog dyads walked a short course with distractions (treats and balls) that dogs should ignore (N = 40) or when they had a ten-minute break together (N = 36). Nine out of 49 behaviour observations, such as verbally praising or correcting the dog and leash tensions, related significantly (comparison-wise two-tailed P < 0.05) to the parenting styles and Spearman rank correlations explained up to 30 % of the variance. The self-report-based dog-directed parenting styles related logically to the way owners actually interacted with their dogs, verbally and by leash. AUI and AUT parenting related directly to verbally praising the dog. AUC parenting related directly to verbally correcting the dog and to leash tensions. Also, AUC parenting related inversely and AUT parenting directly to the dog frequently looking at its owner during the course with distractions. Thus, we find evidence that verbal communication and leash tensions are telling about dog-directed parenting styles and, possibly, constitute meaningful manifestations to address in educational interventions for dog owners. We see potential merit in moving AUC parenting dog owners away from leash-related guidance towards verbal praise-based guidance and a more authoritative dog-directed parenting style.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,NA,NA,"Dogs",2020,"van Herwijnen, Ineke R Wageningen University and Research Behavioural Ecology Group, Department of Animal Sciences, P.O.

Data collection focused on dogs' response to two commands: ""Come"" (recall to trainer) and ""Sit"" (place hindquarters on ground). These were the two most common commands used during training, with improving recall being the target behaviour for the subject dogs. Measures of training efficacy included number of commands given to elicit the response and response latency. Control 2 achieved significantly better responses to both ""Sit"" and ""Come"" commands after a single instruction in the allocated time. These dogs also had shorter response latencies than the E-collar group. There was no significant difference in the proportion of command disobeyed between the three groups, although significantly fewer commands were given to the dogs in Control 2. There was no difference in the number of verbal cues used in each group, but Control 2 used fewer hand and lead signals, and Control 1 made more use of these signals than E-collar group. These findings refute the suggestion that training with an E-collar is either more efficient or results in less disobedience, even in the hands of experienced trainers. In many ways, training with positive reinforcement was found to be more effective at addressing the target behaviour as well as general obedience training. This method of training also poses fewer risks to dog welfare and quality of the human-dog relationship. Given these results we suggest that there is no evidence to indicate that E-collar training is necessary, even for its most widely cited indication.","508 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included"", ""l.c.blake""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: fails new rule",NA,NA,NA,"Dogs;Reinforcement (Psychology)",2020,"Animal Behaviour, Cognition and Welfare Research Group, School of Life Sciences, University of Lincoln, Lincoln, United Kingdom."

The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic-adreno-medullar (SAM) axis are two main physiological pathways that constitute the stress response of an organism. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a mediator of the HPA axis and is known to be related to social behaviour and stress. The serum concentration of AVP is higher in more aggressive dogs and humans with post-traumatic stress disorder. Salivary biomarker analysis is a non-invasive method to assess stress. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possibility of using salivary AVP as an acute stress biomarker in dogs. Salivary AVP concentration was measured before and after exposure to all relevant environmental stimuli (i.e. car trip to the lab, physical examination by the veterinarian, and sampling procedure,) and then after 30‚Äâmin of vacuum noise exposure. behaviour assessments, physiologic parameter assessments, and serum cortisol analysis were conducted in combination. Statistical analysis was conducted separately in the total study population, the less stressed group, and the more stressed group, respectively.Results Based on stress behaviour analysis scores, 28 dogs were classified into less or more stressed groups. All four physiologic parameters (blood pressure, body temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate) were significantly increased after noise and environmental challenges, in the more stressed group. Serum cortisol did not show any significant change. Salivary AVP significantly decreased after noise and environmental stimulation in the more stressed group but not in the less stressed group. Salivary AVP and blood pressure changes were negatively correlated in the more stressed group.Conclusion Salivary AVP may be a potential acute stress biomarker in dogs.","1-9 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,NA,NA,"Dogs;Vasopressins;Biological Markers",2020,"College of Veterinary Medicine, Chungnam National University, 99 Daehak-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 34134, Republic of Korea"

We used a preference test to measure proximity-seeking behaviour of 4-month-old family pigs and dogs in the presence of their caregiver and either a stranger or a familiar object, in a novel environment. We found that both pigs and dogs preferred their caregivers over the familiar object but not over the stranger.

However, the extent to which these helpful behaviour are prosocially motivated remains unclear. To assess the propensity of pet dogs to actively rescue distressed humans without explicit training, this study tested whether sixty pet dogs would release their seemingly trapped owners from a large box. To examine the causal mechanisms that shaped this behaviour the readiness of each dog to open the box was tested in three conditions: (1) the owner sat in the box and called for help (distress test), (2) an experimenter placed high-value food rewards in the box (food test), and (3) the owner sat in the box and calmly read aloud (reading test). Dogs were as likely to release their distressed owner as to retrieve treats from inside the box, indicating that rescuing an owner may be a highly rewarding action for dogs. After accounting for opening ability, dogs released the owner more often when the owner called for help than when the owner read aloud calmly. In addition, opening latencies decreased with test number in the distress test but not the reading test. Thus, rescuing the owner could not be attributed solely to social facilitation, stimulus enhancement, or social contact-seeking behaviour Dogs displayed more stress behaviour in the distress test than in the reading test, and stress scores decreased with test number in the reading test but not in the distress test. This evidence of emotional contagion supports the hypothesis that rescuing the distressed owner was an empathetically-motivated prosocial behaviour Success in the food task and previous (in-home) experience opening objects were both strong predictors of releasing the owner. Thus, prosocial behaviour tests for dogs should control for physical ability and previous experience.","Email Address: jvanbour@asu.edu; Patterson, J. E. (author); Wynne, C. D. L. (author).

Domestic dogs are unusual in that human interaction often reduces stress and behaviour signs of stress. Nevertheless, there is some evidence that the sex of an unfamiliar person can influence canine behaviour To determine whether sex of an unfamiliar walker might influence the behaviour of dogs at an animal shelter, we observed 100 dogs during leash walks and recorded all occurrences of scent-marking behaviour Male dogs urinated at higher rates when walked by unfamiliar women than when walked by unfamiliar men. Female dogs urinated at similar rates when walked by unfamiliar men and unfamiliar women. Sex of walker also influenced urinary posture in male dogs. Both male and female dogs were more likely to defecate when walked by unfamiliar women than when walked by unfamiliar men. Based on our findings, and those of others, we suggest that the sex of all observers and handlers be reported in behaviour studies of dogs and considered in behaviour evaluations at animal shelters, where results can impact whether or not a dog is made available for adoption. Interactions with humans influence the behaviour and physiology of other animals, and the response can vary with sex and familiarity. Dogs in animal shelters face challenging conditions and although contact with humans typically reduces stress and behaviour associated with stress, evidence indicates that shelter dogs react differently to unfamiliar men and women. Given that some aspects of canine scent-marking behaviour change under fearful conditions, we examined whether sex of an unfamiliar walker would influence scent-marking behaviour of 100 shelter dogs during leash walks. Male dogs urinated at higher rates when walked by unfamiliar women than when walked by unfamiliar men; female dogs urinated at similar rates when walked by unfamiliar women and unfamiliar men. Sex of walker influenced urinary posture in male dogs, but not in female dogs. Both male and female dogs were more likely to defecate when walked by unfamiliar women than by unfamiliar men. Based on our findings that shelter dogs behaviour differently in the presence of unfamiliar men and women, we suggest that researchers conducting behaviour studies of dogs record, consider in analyses, and report the sex of observers and handlers as standard practice. We also recommend recording the sex of shelter staff present at behaviour evaluations because the results of these evaluations can impact dog welfare. ¬© 2020 by the authors.

Therapy dogs' impact on human health has been thoroughly studied; however, studies on dog welfare have been limited. Additionally, as dogs have evolved with humans, they have learned to read non-verbal social cues. Dogs can read humans' non-verbal body language and can react to their emotions. However, the body language of dogs is poorly understood and can lead to dog owner-directed aggression. Communication plays a vital role to be a cohesive therapy team. The purpose of this study was to assess perceived stress and cortisol concentrations in therapy dogs and their handlers during the first three visits in a hospital setting. Moreover, the study aimed to investigate whether, while in an overstimulating environment, a therapy dog handler can observe his or her dog's body language and correlate such observations to the dog's stress. Nine therapy dog teams from Mayo Clinic's Caring Canine Program participated in this study. A baseline salivary cortisol was collected from the handler and therapy dog each day of the visits. Once the team arrived, a pre-visit salivary cortisol was collected from the handler and therapy dog and, afterward, a post-visit salivary cortisol. Handlers were also asked to fill out a perceived stress survey on their own stress and that of their therapy dogs'. behaviour was documented by a staff member and the handler. For each visit, the therapy dogs were at the hospital on average 47 min and visited with nine people. There was significant correlation (P = 0.02) between the owner's perceived stress of his or her therapy dog and the dog's salivary cortisol concentrations. The handlers noted medium to high stress, and those dogs had higher cortisol concentrations post-visit. There was no significant difference in salivary cortisol for the handler and therapy dog over the course of the three visits and comparing pre- and post-visit. Overall, the dogs displayed mixed behaviour with the three most reported being panting, lip licking, and yawning. However, salivary cortisol results suggest that the handlers and therapy dogs maintained their welfare state throughout the visits.","564201 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included"", ""l.c.blake""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: pass new rule",NA,NA,NA,"Dogs;Hydrocortisone;Pilot Projects",2020,"Division of General Internal Medicine, Section of Integrative Medicine and Health, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States."

This study investigated human‚Äìdog interactions when volunteers take shelter dogs for an on-leash walk, using video recording and a canine leash tension meter. Male dogs tended to pull more frequently and created higher leash tensions than female dogs. Dogs displayed more stress related behaviour when interacting with men than women, with the signs including spending less time holding the tail in a high position, and more frequent gazing and lip-licking behaviour Finally, during the walk, there was a greater pre-disposition in women to use verbal commands and language typically associated with talking to babies, while men were more inclined to have physical contact with the dogs. These results may be used to match shelter dogs with appropriate men and women volunteers for dog walking exercise, and to improve potential socialisation of the dogs before rehoming.AbstractPrevious studies have indicated that human gender and canine sex influences human‚Äìdog interactions. However, the majority of studies have considered the interaction when dogs were off-leash and the behaviour interactions when dogs are walked on a leash have not been addressed. This study investigated human‚Äìdog interactions when shelter volunteers take shelter dogs for an on-leash walk. Video records were made of 370 walks, involving 74 volunteers and 111 shelter dogs, and a leash tension meter was used to determine the pull strength of dogs and walkers. Human gender and canine sex had dyadic effects during the walk. Male dogs tended to pull more frequently and created increased leash tensions. Dogs displayed more stress related behaviour when interacting with men than women, with the signs being spending less time holding the tail in the high position, and more frequent gazing and lip-licking behaviour Finally, there was a greater pre-disposition in women to use verbal commands, and language typically used with babies, while men were more inclined to have physical contact with dogs.

Attachment style varies across dog-human dyads, with securely attached dogs exhibiting the secure base effect, an ability to find comfort in the presence of an attachment figure in unusual situations, allowing for greater exploration. The secure base effect is also known to facilitate interactions with unfamiliar individuals. Dogs who engage in Animal Assisted Activities (AAA) are often asked to engage with unfamiliar people in unfamiliar environments, therefore it is possible that dogs with a secure attachment to their human handlers may be more prepared for success in this role. This study evaluated the behaviour of 16 dogs who engage in AAA. Using a secure base test dogs were categorized as demonstrating secure (exhibiting the secure base effect with their owner/handler; n=8) or insecure (not exhibiting the secure base effect; n=8) attachment styles toward their handlers. Later the dyads participated in a mock animal assisted activity session to evaluate their working behaviour Our findings indicate that independent of attachment style, dogs who engage in AAA spent significantly more time in proximity to, and touching, the AAA participant than their handler (p<0.001 for both proximity and touch). However, on average the AAA dogs spent significantly more time gazing at their handler than at the participant during the session (p=0.03). Dogs with an insecure attachment style appear to have driven this effect as evidenced by a non-significant trend suggesting that they gazed longer at their handlers than at the participant (p=0.07), whereas secure dogs did not display the same trend (p=0.24). This could suggest that while their training mandates proximity and interaction with unfamiliar people, dogs who engage in AAA may be using gaze to maintain contact with their handlers, especially in the absence of a secure attachment where prolonged comfort seeking from the attachment figure would be expected.","Email Address: shelby.wanser@oregonstate.edu; Udell, M.

Owned dogs were randomly allocated to receive training (n = 15) or no training (n = 22; Control). Owners of dogs in the training group were instructed to perform exam-style handling on their dog and to visit the veterinary clinic weekly. Owners of control dogs were given no instructions. Fear responses were assessed before and after the training period by a blinded observer during clinic arrival and examination. Despite motivated owners volunteering to participate in the current study, 44% of owners were non-compliant to this training program. During examination, control dogs had higher odds (95% confidence Interval (CI)) of reduced posture compared to trained dogs (Odds ratio (OR): 3.79, CI: 1.03‚Äì16.3). Fear scores for trained dogs lowered during the second examination (p = 0.046), and 86.7% of dog owners reported a reduction in their dog‚Äôs fear levels across the training period (p = 0.007).

The interactions of these dogs with humans are quite complex and multidimensional. For the first time, we tested 160 adult free-ranging dogs to understand their ability to follow relatively complex human referential gestures using dynamic and momentary distal pointing cues. We found that these dogs are capable of following distal pointing cues from humans to locate hidden food rewards. However, approximately half of the population tested showed a lack of tendency to participate even after successful familiarization with the experimental setup. A closer inspection revealed that anxious behaviour states of the individuals were responsible for such an outcome. Finally, we compared the results using data from an earlier study with dynamic proximal cues. We found that free-ranging dogs follow distal cues more accurately compared to proximal cue. We assume that life experiences with humans probably shape personalities of free-ranging dogs, which in turn influence their responsiveness to human communicative gestures.","2818 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,NA,NA,"Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Dogs;Cues",2019,"Department of Biological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata, Kolkata, India."

The Field Instantaneous Dog Observation (FIDO) tool was used to assess behaviour during a 4-step stranger approach test. At each step, the dog was given a RYG score; R, red (fearful), Y, yellow (ambivalent), or G, green (affiliative or neutral). After behaviour assessment, 50 mg of hair was shaved from each dog's lower back for analysis of hair cortisol concentration (HCC). A FitBark monitor collected 24 -hs of activity data. Additionally, a questionnaire was developed to interview each facility owner about their management practices. Overall mean HCC (n= 266) was 8.92 pg/mg (2.01-108.99 +/-14.24 pg/mg) while mean HCC at each facility ranged from 5.65 to 38.48 pg/mg. Mean activity score (n= 250) was 9.04 +/- 4.3 and ranged from 2.8 to 32.8. Eight components from a principal component analysis (PCA) were retained as predictors in two mixed effects linear regression models. In Model 1, the component Socialization was significantly associated with HCC (p= 0.01).

Over half the dogs assessed using the stranger approach test exhibited fearful responses, suggesting that they might be at greater risk for problems if selected to transition to a new home. Additionally, the breeders' management practices varied widely, with the number of socialization practices employed inversely associated with HCC.

For 29 owner-dog dyads, we employed a modified Ainsworth‚Äôs Strange Situation Test (SST) to investigate whether both members would show a physiological reaction to separation. Dogs experienced a series of separation from and reuniting events with their owners and were introduced to a stranger. Before and after the SST, saliva samples were taken from each dyad to measure stress-related analytes: cortisol (CORT) and chromogranin A (CgA). Dogs exhibited attachment behaviour toward owners as evidenced by more time spent in close proximity, more contact initiated and less time spent near the door, compared to episodes with the stranger. Dogs that initiated more contact with their owners in re-uniting episodes had lower CgA than dogs that initiated less contact, but their owners had higher CgA levels. Also during re-uniting episodes, dogs and owners spent more time near each other when owner CgA levels were low, owner CORT levels were high, and the dog had owner-reported separation anxiety. During the episodes alone with the stranger, dogs with higher CORT spent more time with the stranger. Finally, dogs‚Äô initial CgA levels were correlated with their owner‚Äôs initial CORT levels, and dog final CORT levels were correlated with their owners‚Äô final CORT levels, suggesting some hormonal synchrony within the dyad. As all owner-dog dyads were assessed as securely attached, attachment style differences could not explain variation in hormonal or behaviour results. These results suggest that dogs may respond to owner hormonal state and/or behaviour and demonstrate that individual differences in responses to a behaviour challenge reflect the stress physiology of both dogs and their owners. ¬© Copyright ¬© 2019 Ryan, Storey, Anderson and Walsh.","Cited By :7     Export Date: 17 May 2022     Correspondence Address: Ryan, M.G.; Cognitive and Behavioural Ecology Program, Canada; email: morag.g.ryan@mun.ca | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}","10.3389/fnbeh.2019.00162",NA,NA,"attachment;chromogranin A (CgA);cortisol;dog;strange situation test;Dogs",2019,"Cognitive and Behavioural Ecology Program, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John‚Äôs, NL, Canada     Department of Psychology, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John‚Äôs, NL, Canada     Department of Biology, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John‚Äôs, NL, Canada"

In the present study, we analyzed the salivary fluctuations of these neuropeptides in both behaviour normal dogs and dogs with separation distress in response to a three-minute separation from the owner, in a new environment. Dogs with a previous diagnosis of separation distress showed more anxiety-related behaviour and higher concentrations of vasopressin than control dogs when separated from the owner. Further research is needed on the potential use of salivary vasopressin as an early, non-invasive biomarker of anxiety-related disorders in pet dogs.AbstractPhysiological biomarkers of canine anxiety have not been extensively investigated to date. To identify new biomarkers in dogs, we compared behaviour normal dogs (Control group, N = 13) to dogs diagnosed with separation problems (Case group, N = 13) as they were introduced into a novel environment in the presence of two strangers and subjected to a short episode of separation and reunion with the owner. During the separation phase, dogs in the Case group explored significantly less than controls and were significantly more persistent in expressing passive stress-coping strategies aimed at seeking proximity to their owners. When the owners returned, dogs with separation distress spent significantly more time jumping up on the strangers than control dogs did. Salivary oxytocin and vasopressin concentrations did not differ between samples taken before and after the separation. However, vasopressin concentrations immediately after separation were significantly higher in the Case than in the Control group and remained higher, although not significantly so, 10 min later. These results indicated that dogs with separation distress became more anxious than typical dogs when separated from their owner in an unfamiliar environment and provided preliminary support for the use of salivary vasopressin as a possible biomarker for anxiety-related responses in dogs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,NA,NA,"Biological Markers;Dogs;Vasopressins;Anxiety",2019,"Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Milan, via Celoria 10, 20133 Milan, Italy; andrea.bossetti@gmail.com (A.B.); mariangela.albertini@unimi.it (M.A.) .

We investigated whether and in what way the behaviour of dogs towards new handlers is affected by positive reinforcement training. Twenty shelter dogs received six sessions with positive reinforcement training (PRT) over two weeks, with nine control dogs receiving the normal shelter procedures including occasional leash walks with volunteers. Before and after the two-week training/control period, the dogs were submitted to a simple temperament test and a standardized leash walk, which included two obedience exercises. To simulate interactions with a new owner, the dog handlers in all tests were not known to the dog. Dogs in the training group established eye contact with the dog handler less often than did dogs in the control group, perhaps because trained dogs were more confident, reducing the need for checking with the handler. Training reduced the likelihood that dogs showed a startle response in the umbrella test. Trained shelter dogs performed better than controls in the exercises ""sit"" and ""lie"", indicating that training made them more controllable and cooperative, even with an unknown human handler. We conclude that shelter dogs benefit from PRT by improved stress management and by becoming more confident and cooperative with potential adopters. This may increase their odds of being adopted and reduce the risk of their being returned to the shelter.","Email Address: renateploder@hotmail.com; Kotrschal, K. (author). Issue Info: 106, 1/2.

Eleven dogs were tested using a modified version of Ainsworth Strange Situation Test where all the family members (five 2-member, two 3-member, and four 4-member families) were contemporaneously present. The duration of 19 non-social (proximity to door/chair, behaviour towards door/chair/shoe, oriented to door, exploration, locomotion, passive behaviour individual play, vocalisations, and whining) and social (attention seeking, physical contact, following, proximity, approach, and visual orientation) dog behaviour was measured. The latter were assessed towards each participant. A questionnaire, including the Lexington Attachment to Pets Scale, was used to gather information on the relationship between people and the tested dog. The analysis of data revealed that most dogs (n=8; 72.7%) living in a multi-member family show a stronger bond to a specific member. Owners usually (75.0%) were able to identify the person the dog was more bonded to. It was not found a correlation between the level of attachment of a specific owner to the dog and the bond of this dog to that specific owner (57.12¬±15.42 versus 58.00¬±18.95; F=0.00; p=0.955). Among dogs who showed a preference, the majority (n=6; 75.0%) preferred people who managed the dogs almost totally by themselves; for the remaining two, the preferred person was the one within the family who dealt with walking and food or walking and play. Therefore, walking the dog seems to increase the likelihood of establishing a strong bond with the dog.","Email Address: chiara.mariti@unipi.it; Sighieri, C. (author); Gazzano, A.

Owning a dog classified as dangerous is subject to conditions, such as passing a temperament test. The aim of this study is to examine the relation between the reason of the dogs'classified dangerousness and its behaviour during the temperament test. In the retrospective evaluation of 124 temperament test reports, which were created at the Institute for Animal Welfare and behaviour no connection could be established between breed, age or sex of the dog and failing the temperament test. Dogs which were classified as dangerous due to a biting incident with a human, showed significantly more aggressive behaviour in the test situations of the dog-human contact and failed the temperament test more often than dogs, which were presented due to a biting Irvrident with another animal. Thus, the te;t situations in dog-human contact have a high reliability whereas the test situations in dog-dog contact do not appear sufficiently differentiated in this study. However, a temperament test is always only a snapshot and can only form statements about the observed behaviour The significance of the test result could be increased by acditionally examining the behaviour towards known key stimuli as well as the behaviour in their own territory. In addition, a standardization of the test design and the test evafuation is strongly recommended. ¬© 2019 Schluetersche Verlagsgesellschaft mbH and Co.KG.

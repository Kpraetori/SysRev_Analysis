","Consistent owner-dog interaction patterns such as dog-directed parenting styles could reflect in the leash tension applied when walking a dog. Rein sensors are commonly used to measure tension applied to a horse's bit and our research aim was to evaluate the performance of this methodology for measuring leash tension. We evaluated the consistency of leash tension measurements in owner-dog dyads walking a food-distraction course and a more complex zigzag object-distraction course to confirm our prediction that the more challenging course would trigger increased leash tension. Leash tension sample points were averaged per owner-dog dyad per course, and we used restricted maximum likelihood to analyze leash tensions for effects of course difficulty and dog body weight. In 24 participating owner-dog dyads, leash tension was an average (¬±standard deviation) 18.29 ¬± 14.03 newtons. Leash tensions were 1.6 times higher (P < 0.001) during the more challenging second course than during the easier first one and variation between owner-dog dyads was consistent across the two courses (rank correlation of 0.63, P = 0.001, N = 24). Our findings support the usefulness of rein sensors for measuring leash tension, with potential applications in studies on the owner-dog relationship such as how leash exerted levels of control relate to dog-directed parenting styles.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included"", ""l.c.blake""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: fails new rule",NA,Dogs,NA,NA

","Veterinary practices can be stressful places for dogs. Decreasing stress during veterinary consultations is therefore a major concern, since animal welfare matters both for owners and veterinarians. Stress can be expressed through behaviour modifications; monitoring canine behaviour is thus one way to assess stress levels. We also know that the owner can affect dog behaviour in different ways. The aim of this study was therefore to assess the effect of the presence of owners on the behaviour of their dogs in veterinary consultations. We studied 25 dog-owner dyads at two standardised veterinary consultations, conducted at intervals of 5‚Äì7 weeks; the owner was present for the first consultation and absent for the second (O/NoO group, n = 12), or vice versa (NoO/O group, n = 13). A consultation consisted in three phases: exploration, examination, greeting. Dog behaviours were compared between the two conditions using a video recording.¬†Despite some limitations (e.g. no male owners, the exclusion of aggressive dogs, a limited sample size, minimally invasive veterinary examinations, restricted owner-dog interactions), our results showed that the presence or absence of the owner had no significant effect on the stress-related behaviour of the dog or the veterinarian‚Äôs ability to handle the animal during the examination phase (P > 0.05). Nevertheless, the behaviour of the dogs towards people was affected before, during, and after the veterinary examination. In the presence of their owner, dogs were more willing to enter the consultation room (P < 0.05), and they appeared more relaxed during the exploration phase (P < 0.01). During the examination, dogs looked in direction of their owner in both situations (owner present and behind the door, respectively; P < 0.001). These results suggest that allowing the owner to stay in the room during veterinary consultations is a better option for canine welfare.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included"", ""l.c.blake""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: pass new rule",NA,Dogs;Referral and Consultation,NA,NA

","Animal-assisted interventions (AAIs) are increasingly popular throughout the world, with a growing trend. Despite all their potential benefits, there are certain risks to both humans and animals involved in AAI programs that should not be disregarded, such as the burnout of the animals. This study investigated the welfare of dogs during AAIs in Portugal. Three welfare indicators related to stress were assessed in nineteen dogs of nineteen human-dog dyads: salivary cortisol concentration, heart rate (HR), and respiratory rate. These measurements were carried out at two time points: at home and after session. This combined assessment allows for the evaluation of the two main neurohormonal pathways related to stress responses: the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis. Along with monitoring these indicators, a questionnaire was given to each animal handler immediately before the sample collection, to collect demographic data about his/her dog and to characterize the AAI session they were involved in. Statistically significant differences were found (P < 0.05) among the indicators' mean/median values at home and after an AAI session, with the postsession values being higher. Dogs involved in animal-assisted activities had significantly higher mean HR values after session when compared with the ones involved in animal-assisted therapies (P = 0.015), despite all of them being within the normal range. The dogs subjected to a transport time of longer than fifty minutes also had significantly higher mean HR (P = 0.007) and median respiratory rate (P = 0.0001) after session. Most of the dogs (n = 15) had salivary cortisol concentration values within what is considered to be the normal range (<0.3 Œºg/dL) with only one dog having an extremely high value (1.101 Œºg/dL) that was attributed to the entrance protocol in the AAI site and to the characteristics of the session itself. The analysis of the three indicators did not raise severe concern about the welfare of the monitored dogs, but some practices that should be avoided were identified: long transport to the AAI site (‚â•50 minutes); performing AAI in excessively warm rooms; and entering schools during children's playtime.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included"", ""l.c.blake""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: pass new rule",NA,Dogs;Heart Rate;Hydrocortisone,NA,NA

","We assessed the efficacy of dog training with and without remote electronic collars compared to training with positive reinforcement. A total of 63 dogs with known off-lead behavioral problems such as poor recall were allocated to one of three training groups (each n = 21), receiving up to 150 min of training over 5 days to improve recall and general obedience. The 3 groups were: E-collar-manufacturer-nominated trainers who used electronic stimuli as part of their training program; Control 1-the same trainers following practices they would apply when not using electronic stimuli; and Control 2-independent, professional trainers who focused primarily on positive reinforcement for their training. Data collection focused on dogs' response to two commands: ""Come"" (recall to trainer) and ""Sit"" (place hindquarters on ground). These were the two most common commands used during training, with improving recall being the target behavior for the subject dogs. Measures of training efficacy included number of commands given to elicit the response and response latency. Control 2 achieved significantly better responses to both ""Sit"" and ""Come"" commands after a single instruction in the allocated time. These dogs also had shorter response latencies than the E-collar group. There was no significant difference in the proportion of command disobeyed between the three groups, although significantly fewer commands were given to the dogs in Control 2. There was no difference in the number of verbal cues used in each group, but Control 2 used fewer hand and lead signals, and Control 1 made more use of these signals than E-collar group. These findings refute the suggestion that training with an E-collar is either more efficient or results in less disobedience, even in the hands of experienced trainers. In many ways, training with positive reinforcement was found to be more effective at addressing the target behavior as well as general obedience training. This method of training also poses fewer risks to dog welfare and quality of the human-dog relationship. Given these results we suggest that there is no evidence to indicate that E-collar training is necessary, even for its most widely cited indication.","508 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included"", ""l.c.blake""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: fails new rule",NA,Dogs;Reinforcement (Psychology),NA,NA

","Dogs synchronise their behaviour with those of their owners when confronted with an unfamiliar situation and interactions with their owners have been shown to decrease the dog‚Äôs stress levels in some instances. However, whether owners may help manage dog anxiety during veterinary consultations remains unclear. In Part I, we compared the behaviour of dogs in the presence or absence of their owners during consultations, which consisted in three phases: exploration, examination, and greeting. Our findings suggest that allowing owners to attend consultations may be beneficial for dogs. In Part II, we investigated the direct relationship between owners‚Äô actions and their dog‚Äôs behaviour. Using the videos from Part I, we examined whether: (1) dogs interact more when their owner is more interactive; (2) owners‚Äô stress scores are related to canine stress-related behaviour and emotional state; (3) owners‚Äô actions influence canine stress-related behaviours, emotional state and tolerance to manipulations; (4) canine stress-related behaviours and emotional state are associated with increased eye contact with their owners. We analysed the recordings of 29 dog-owner dyads submitted to a veterinary consultation in Part I. The behaviours of the dogs and their owners were analysed, and their emotional states were scored. The ease of manipulations was also scored.¬†Despite limitations (e.g. no physical contact during examinations, no invasive procedures, aggressive dogs excluded, no male owners, limited sample size), our study showed a link between dog and owner behaviours: when owners attended an examination, their negative behaviours intensified the signs of anxiety in their dogs. Additionally, visual and verbal attempts to comfort their dog had no significant effect. However, we observed that the more dogs displayed stress-related behaviours, the more they established eye contact with their owners, suggesting that dogs seek information (through social referencing) or reassurance from their owners.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included"", ""l.c.blake""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: pass new rule",NA,Dogs;Referral and Consultation,NA,NA

This work explores jealousy in dogs one step further. We conducted two studies adapting a procedure devised to assess jealousy in human infants. In each study 36 adult dogs were exposed to a situation in which their owner and a stranger ignored them while directing positive attention towards three different objects: a book, a puppet and a fake dog (Study 1: furry; Study 2: plastic). Overall, the results of both studies do not provide evidence that the behavioral responses of our dogs were triggered by jealousy: we did not find a clear indication that the fake dogs were perceived as real social rivals, neither the furry nor the plastic one. Indeed, dogs exhibited a higher interest (i.e. look at, interact with) towards the fake dogs, but differences in the behavior towards the fake dog and the puppet only emerged in Study 2. In addition, many of the behaviors (protest, stress, attention seeking, aggression) that are considered distinctive features of jealousy were not expressed or were expressed to a limited extent, revealing that dogs did not actively try to regain their owner‚Äôs attention or interfere with the interaction between the owner and the faux rival. Finally, a differentiated response towards the attachment figure (the owner) and the unfamiliar person (the stranger) did not emerge. Differently from what reported in human infants, dogs‚Äô behavior towards the attachment figure and the stranger interacting with the potential competitor (in this case, the fake dog) did not significantly differ: in both studies dogs paid attention to the owner and the stranger manipulating the fake dog to the same extent. In conclusion, we do not exclude that dogs could possess a rudimentary form of jealousy, but we suggest that research on this topic should require the use of a real social interloper (conspecific or human) and more naturalistic procedures.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included"", ""l.c.blake""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: pass new rule",NA,Dogs,NA,NA

","Oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) are neuropeptides with diverse effects on social behavior, cognition and stress responses. Recent studies suggest that OT facilitates and responds to affiliative forms of human-animal interaction (HAI). However, previous studies measuring OT and AVP in dogs have been limited to measures from blood or urine, which present concerns related to the invasiveness of sample collection, the potential for matrix interference in immunoassays, and whether samples can be collected at precise time points to assess event-linked endocrine responses. Previous studies from our laboratory validated salivary measures of OT and AVP in dogs, however, it is currently unknown whether these measures respond dynamically to aspects of HAI. Here, we investigated the effects of affiliative forms of HAI on both plasma and salivary OT and AVP in dogs. We employed a within- and between-subjects design with a group of Labrador retrievers and Labrador retriever √ó golden retriever crosses (23 females, 15 males). Half of the dogs engaged in 10 min of free-form friendly interaction with a human experimenter (HAI condition), and the other half rested quietly in the same environment, without human interaction (control condition). We collected blood and saliva samples before, and immediately following both experimental conditions, and all samples were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) following previously validated protocols. Dogs participating in HAI exhibited a significant increase in both salivary OT (+39%) and plasma OT (+5.7%) whereas dogs in the control group did not. Salivary AVP showed no change in the HAI group but increased significantly (+33%) in the control group. Plasma AVP decreased significantly following HAI (-13%) but did not change across time in the control condition. Within the dogs exposed to HAI, increases in salivary OT, and decreases in plasma AVP, were predicted by the extent of affiliative behavior between the dog and human (indexed by scores from a principal components analysis of social behaviors between the dog and human). Collectively our results suggest that measures of salivary OT and AVP provide useful biomarkers in studies of HAI, and afford a flexible and non-invasive toolkit than can be employed in diverse research contexts.","1606 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included"", ""l.c.blake""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: pass new rule",NA,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Dogs;Animals;Vasopressins;Oxytocin;MSH Release-Inhibiting Hormone;Animal Shells,NA,NA

Recent studies have provided evidence for overimitation in canines, but mainly when their human caregiver‚Äînot an unfamiliar person‚Äîis demonstrating the irrelevant action. Therefore, we hypothesized that dogs show overimitation as a result of affiliation. Here, we tested if the eagerness to overimitate is influenced by the relationship quality between dog and caregiver by measuring, on the one hand, their relationship and on the other hand, the overimitation tendency. Although our overall results were not significant, our data might suggest that, on average, the dogs who overimitated might also show more referential and affiliative behaviours towards the owner (like gazing, synchronization and greeting) than dogs who showed less or no copying of the irrelevant action. Possible reasons for these negative findings are discussed, together with the implications for dog owners.AbstractOverimitation, the copying of causally irrelevant or non-functional actions, is well-known from humans but completely absent in other primates. Recent studies from our lab have provided evidence for overimitation in canines. Previously, we found that half of tested pet dogs copied their human caregiver‚Äôs irrelevant action, while only few did so when the action was demonstrated by an unfamiliar experimenter. Therefore, we hypothesized that dogs show overimitation as a result of socio-motivational grounds. To test this more specifically, here we investigated how the relationship with the caregiver influenced the eagerness to overimitate. Given the high variability in the tendency to overimitate their caregiver, we hypothesized that not only familiarity but also relationship quality influences whether dogs faithfully copy their caregiver. For this purpose, on the one hand we measured the overimitation tendency (with the same test as in the two studies before) and on the other hand the relationship quality between the dogs and their caregivers. Although we found no significant correlation between the two test results, our data might suggest that, on average, dogs who overimitated seemed to show more referential and affiliative behaviours towards the owner than dogs who showed less or no copying of the irrelevant action. Notably, as a group, those dogs that showed the highest level of copying accuracy of the irrelevant action showed the highest level of gazing and synchronization towards the owner.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included"", ""l.c.blake""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: fails new rule",NA,Dogs;Caregivers,NA,NA

Our results revealed that the owner cannot be replaced by a familiar person in situations provoking elevated anxiety and fear.In contrasts, dogs did not discriminate between the owner and the familiar person in those tests that were based on obedient behaviour or behaviour towards an assertive person (Tests 2, 3, 7 and 8). Dogs‚Äô former training experience reduced the difference between their behaviour towards the owner and the familiar person in situations requiring obedience but it did not mask it totally. The dogs‚Äô behaviour towards each of the humans participating in the tests was consistent all over the test series.In summary, dogs discriminated between their owner and the unfamiliar person and always preferred the owner to the unfamiliar person.

","Therapy dogs provide health benefits for individuals who suffer from illnesses, such as dementia, depression, loneliness, and aggression. Therapy dogs' impact on human health has been thoroughly studied; however, studies on dog welfare have been limited. Additionally, as dogs have evolved with humans, they have learned to read non-verbal social cues. Dogs can read humans' non-verbal body language and can react to their emotions. However, the body language of dogs is poorly understood and can lead to dog owner-directed aggression. Communication plays a vital role to be a cohesive therapy team. The purpose of this study was to assess perceived stress and cortisol concentrations in therapy dogs and their handlers during the first three visits in a hospital setting. Moreover, the study aimed to investigate whether, while in an overstimulating environment, a therapy dog handler can observe his or her dog's body language and correlate such observations to the dog's stress. Nine therapy dog teams from Mayo Clinic's Caring Canine Program participated in this study. A baseline salivary cortisol was collected from the handler and therapy dog each day of the visits. Once the team arrived, a pre-visit salivary cortisol was collected from the handler and therapy dog and, afterward, a post-visit salivary cortisol. Handlers were also asked to fill out a perceived stress survey on their own stress and that of their therapy dogs'. Behavior was documented by a staff member and the handler. For each visit, the therapy dogs were at the hospital on average 47 min and visited with nine people. There was significant correlation (P = 0.02) between the owner's perceived stress of his or her therapy dog and the dog's salivary cortisol concentrations. The handlers noted medium to high stress, and those dogs had higher cortisol concentrations post-visit. There was no significant difference in salivary cortisol for the handler and therapy dog over the course of the three visits and comparing pre- and post-visit. Overall, the dogs displayed mixed behaviors, with the three most reported being panting, lip licking, and yawning. However, salivary cortisol results suggest that the handlers and therapy dogs maintained their welfare state throughout the visits.","564201 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included"", ""l.c.blake""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: pass new rule",NA,Dogs;Hydrocortisone;Pilot Projects,NA,NA

MTA-ELTE Comparative Ethology Research Group, 1117 Budapest, Hungary ","Simple SummaryDogs have been shown to form attachment bonds towards their owners analogous to the human infant-parent attachment. In humans, the neurological background of variation in attachment and similar trait-like social behaviors has been described. It is known that certain sleep parameters are in association with an individual‚Äôs attachment-related traits. In the current study, we provide the first evidence that dogs‚Äô attachment towards their owner is also associated to dogs‚Äô sleep structure (the time they spend in the different sleep stages) as well as to their brain activity during sleep. Thus, as in humans, when dogs sleep in a novel environment (in the presence of their owners), differences in their attachment bond are reflected in their sleep EEG characteristics.AbstractAffective neuroscience studies have demonstrated the impact of social interactions on sleep quality. In humans, trait-like social behaviors, such as attachment, are related to sleep brain activity patterns. Our aim was to investigate associations between companion dogs‚Äô spontaneous brain activity during sleep (in the presence of the owner) and their relevant behavior in a task-free social context assessing their attachment towards the owner. In random order, each dog participated in a non-invasive sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) measurement and in the Strange Situation Test (SST) to assess their attachment behavior. We found that higher attachment scores were associated with more time spent in NREM sleep, lower NREM alpha power activity and lower NREM alpha‚Äìdelta anticorrelation. Our results reveal that, when dogs sleep in a novel environment in the company of their owners, differences in their attachment are reflected in their sleep EEG characteristics. This could be best explained by the different degree that owners could be used as a safe haven in an unfamiliar environment and during the unusual procedure of the first EEG measurement.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included"", ""l.c.blake""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: pass new rule",NA,Dogs;Electroencephalography,NA,NA

","Canine Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome (CCDS) is a syndrome of progressive cognitive decline comparable to Alzheimer's Disease. The sustained gaze test captures attention loss associated with CCDS in laboratory settings, and adapting the sustained gaze test for use by owners at home could greatly increase the data generated on CCDS. We hypothesized that it would be feasible for owners to perform the sustained gaze test at home, and that results would be reliable over repeated trials. Training materials were developed and dog owners underwent training and performed the test in triplicate at weekly intervals for 3 weeks. Gaze videos and a CAnine DEmentia Scale (CADES) questionnaire were submitted each week. Videos were examined for inclusion and duration of gaze was recorded. One observer repeated video assessments twice, 1 week apart; five different observers assessed videos once. Outcome measures included the relationship between CADES and gaze duration, test-retest reliability of owner-performed sustained gaze testing, and intra- and inter-rater reliability. Twenty dogs aged 7-15.5 years completed testing. The majority of videos were acceptable (162/183). Within dog test-retest reliability was excellent (ICC = 0.96). Intra- and interobserver reliability for determining video validity for inclusion were substantial (k = 0.76 and 0.78, respectively); for duration of gaze these were excellent (ICC = 0.99 and 0.96, respectively). Gaze duration was significantly associated with CADES (p = 0.0026). We conclude that owners can perform the sustained gaze test at home and that data generated are reliable and correlate to CADES, a validated measure of dementia.","819135 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included"", ""l.c.blake""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Relevance?,fails new rule",NA,Dogs,NA,NA

One way to test this hypothesis is with the predictions of the Yerkes-Dodson law. The law posits that arousal level, a component of temperament, affects problem solving in an inverted U-shaped relationship: Optimal performance is reached at intermediate levels of arousal and impeded by high and low levels. Thus, a powerful test of the emotional-reactivity hypothesis is to compare cognitive performance in dog populations that have been bred and trained based in part on their arousal levels. We therefore compared a group of pet dogs to a group of assistance dogs bred and trained for low arousal (N = 106) on a task of inhibitory control involving a detour response. Consistent with the Yerkes-Dodson law, assistance dogs, which began the test with lower levels of baseline arousal, showed improvements when arousal was artificially increased. In contrast, pet dogs, which began the test with higher levels of baseline arousal, were negatively affected when their arousal was increased. Furthermore, the dogs' baseline levels of arousal, as measured in their rate of tail wagging, differed by population in the expected directions. Low-arousal assistance dogs showed the most inhibition in a detour task when humans eagerly encouraged them, while more highly aroused pet dogs performed worst on the same task with strong encouragement. Our findings support the hypothesis that selection on temperament can have important implications for cognitive performance.","1317-1329 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included"", ""l.c.blake""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Relevance?,fails new rule",NA,Arousal;Dogs,NA,NA

The Ethiopian village dogs surveyed in this study have similar characteristics to other free-roaming dog populations in the world: (1) they are almost entirely unrestrained, (2) there is a male-skewed sex ratio in the adult population, (3) the majority appear not to be owned (or at least not declared so) and (4) many of them are found around people's dwellings. We also evaluated 'village' dogs' attitudes towards people using a stranger-approach test. Eighty-five dogs were approached by an unfamiliar Caucasian woman in different contexts and the dogs'vocal behaviour before the approach, reaction to the approach and approaching distance between dogs and observer were systematically recorded. We found variability in village dog behavioural responses to a stranger depending on dogs' location (inside house, outside house, street), social setting (alone, pair, group) and village. Dogs inside homes and dogs that were alone were more likely to vocalize towards the observer than dogs in the street. Avoiding was the most common reaction exhibited by village dogs, especially when approached in the streets, suggesting that most of them are shy of people. However, 11% responded aggressively towards the observer; all of these dogs vocalized towards the observer before she approached them. One third of the dogs maintained a neutral attitude apparently ignoring the observer. Slightly less than one third of village dogs could be approached closely (0-2m), one third could be approached at a medium distance (2-5m), and over one third could not be approached at all (>5m). Altogether, our findings showed that the dog populations in the villages we studied were not behaviourally homogeneous, within and between villages. Our study suggests that behavioural investigations are useful for characterizing free-roaming/village dogs' attitudes, especially when assessing any risk dogs pose to the human population. Our observations suggest that people might have greater chances of being bitten by dogs that: vocalize towards people, are alone or in pairs, and are found inside households. Our ""approach test"" proved to be a simple, effective way of measuring dog attitudes, which could be easily implemented in different parts of the world by training local people. Quantifying behavioural responses of village dogs towards people would be particularly important in areas of the world where potentially fatal dog-transmitted diseases, such as rabies, are still prevalent.","p. 210-218 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included"", ""l.c.blake""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: fails new rule,unsure new rule",NA,Dogs,NA,NA

No significant differences were observed in the encounter test when the dogs were approached by a familiar caretaker or by an unfamiliar person. Nearly all of the dogs could be caught easily, and they exhibited pronounced interest in and established contacts with both persons. We simulated an experimental manipulation by placing the dogs on a treatment table in an examination room and having them restrained by a familiar caretaker; this resulted in submissive behavior and/or signs of distress in many dogs (e.g., 12% urinated when being lifted onto the examination table and most dogs showed muzzle licking on the table). Multifactorial analysis of variance revealed that, based on most of the calculated scores, the facility-bred dogs were significantly less fearful than those obtained from commercial breeders or from other research facilities. Sex differences were not observed, and younger dogs were significantly more difficult to catch.

","For a long time, oxytocin has been thought to have a generally positive effect on social cognition and prosocial behavior; however, recent results suggested that oxytocin has beneficial effects only under certain conditions. The aim of the present study was to explore potential associations between social competence and the effect of intranasal oxytocin on the social behavior of laboratory beagle dogs. We expected oxytocin treatment to have a more pronounced positive effect on dogs with lower baseline performance in a social test battery. Thirty-six adult dogs of both sexes received 32 IU intranasal oxytocin and physiological saline (placebo) treatment in a double-blind, cross-over design, with 17-20 days between the two sessions. Forty minutes after the treatment, dogs participated in a social test battery consisting of eight situations. The situations were carried out within one session and took 20-30 min to complete. Principal component analysis on the coded behaviors identified four components (Willingness to interact, Preference for social contact, Non-aversive response to nonsocial threat, and Non-aversive response to social threat). The subjects' behavior during the placebo condition was used to assess their baseline performance. We found that oxytocin treatment had a differential effect on the behavior depending on the baseline performance of the individuals in all components, but only two treatment √ó baseline performance interactions remained significant in a less sensitive analysis. In accordance with our hypothesis, oxytocin administration increased dogs' contact seeking and affiliative behaviors toward humans but only for those with low baseline performance. Dogs with low baseline performance also showed significantly more positive (friendly) reactions to social threat after oxytocin administration than after placebo, while for dogs with high baseline performance, oxytocin administration led to a more negative (fearful) reaction. These results indicate that similar to those on humans, the effects of oxytocin on dogs' social behavior are not universally positive but are constrained by individual characteristics and the context. Nevertheless, oxytocin administration has the potential to improve the social behavior of laboratory beagle dogs that are socially less proficient when interacting with humans, which could have both applied and animal welfare implications.","785805 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included"", ""l.c.blake""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: pass new rule",NA,Dogs;MSH Release-Inhibiting Hormone;Social Behavior;Oxytocin,NA,NA

As such, they use their owners as a secure base, exploring the environment and manipulating objects more when accompanied by their owners than when alone. Although there are some indications that owners serve as a better secure base than other human beings, the evidence regarding a strong owner-stranger differentiation in a manipulative context is not straightforward. In the present study, we conducted two experiments in which pet dogs were tested in an object-manipulation task in the presence of the owner and of a stranger, varying how the human partner would behave (i.e. remaining silent or encouraging the dog, Experiment 1), and when alone (Experiment 2). Further, to gain a better insight into the mechanisms behind a potential owner-stranger differentiation, we investigated the effect of dogs‚Äô previous life history (i.e. having lived in a shelter or having lived in the same household since puppyhood). Overall, we found that strangers do not provide a secure base effect and that former shelter dogs show a stronger owner-stranger differentiation than other family dogs. As former shelter dogs show more behavioural signs correlated with anxiety towards the novel environment and the stranger, we concluded that having been re-homed does not necessarily affect the likelihood of forming a secure bond with the new owner but might have an impact on how dogs interact with novel stimuli, including unfamiliar humans. These results confirm the owner‚Äôs unique role in providing security to their dogs and have practical implications for the bond formation in pet dogs with a past in a shelter.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included"", ""l.c.blake""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: pass new rule",NA,Dogs;Problem Solving,NA,NA

Fear in kenneled dogs is a serious behavioral welfare concern as it may lead to both acute and chronic stress. Novel social and non-social stimuli have been shown to elicit behaviors associated with fear in animals. New knowledge on the levels of fear in dogs from CBKs could be used to further refine protocols intended for assessment of welfare in CBKs and to improve breeders‚Äô management practices. The aim of this study, therefore, was to evaluate how dogs from CBKs reacted to social (i.e., a person approaching) and non-social (i.e., a traffic cone and a dog statue) stimuli, and to perform a preliminary evaluation of how these responses might be used as indicators of dogs‚Äô overall socialization levels in kennels. Results revealed that dogs had primarily mildly fearful responses to the stimuli presented. These findings are encouraging as extreme fearful reactions were rarely recorded. Nevertheless, there is a clear margin for commercial breeders to improve the socialization protocols in their kennels to better incorporate both social and non-social stimuli.AbstractUnderstanding the behavioral welfare of dogs in commercial breeding kennels (CBKs) is important for improving breeders‚Äô management practices as well as dog welfare. In the current study, breeding dogs from CBKs were exposed to novel stimuli to evaluate their behavioral responses, with emphasis on indicators of fear. Subjects were presented with a standard stranger-approach test, a traffic cone, and a realistic dog statue. Sixty dogs were exposed to the three stimuli and behavioral responses were scored using an ethogram developed for this study. Dogs spent significantly more time investigating the environment, staying further away from the stimulus, and they took longer to approach and investigate when presented with the cone than with the dog statue or stranger (p< 0.01). These findings suggest that the cone elicited more fear-related behaviors than the dog statue and stranger. Given these results, in addition to socializing their dogs to unfamiliar people and other dogs within their kennels, commercial breeders should be encouraged to increase the exposure of their dogs to more diverse novel stimuli to reduce non-social fear and support the welfare of dogs while they reside in the kennel and when they transition to new homes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included"", ""l.c.blake""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: pass new rule",NA,Dogs;Breeding,NA,NA

This test was used on 14 LGDs, 7 of which were operational and 7 of which were being used as breeding stock. In total, 16 behavioral variables were measured. A Principal Components Analysis reduced these to 5 underlying personality traits: ‚ÄúPlayfulness,‚Äù ‚ÄúTrainability,‚Äù ‚ÄúIndependence,‚Äù ‚ÄúSociability with people‚Äù and ‚ÄúReactivity.‚Äù When 14 dogs were tested 3 times, 20 days apart, the traits ‚ÄúPlayfulness,‚Äù ‚ÄúTrainability‚Äù and ‚ÄúIndependence‚Äù were found to be consistent. ‚ÄúTrainability‚Äù was negatively correlated to dog age. Dogs with a higher ‚ÄúTrainability‚Äù and lower ‚ÄúReactivity‚Äù showed a tendency to be rated as more effective by their herdsman. Dogs scoring higher for ‚ÄúPlayfulness‚Äù were more likely to be reported to harass stock, and dogs that chased a moving object under experimental conditions were generally rated higher for tendency to chase predator wildlife when working. This study suggests that there are personality attributes which can be measured and are consistent across time in LGDs. Several of these are linked to better performance in trained dogs. Whether these are predictive of later performance in untrained dogs, is yet to be ascertained.","p. 11-19 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included"", ""l.c.blake""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: fails new rule",NA,Dogs,NA,NA

We focused here on dogs‚Äô preference for petting and vocal praise, and the influence that familiarity (owner vs. stranger) has on that preference. We first used concurrent choice to evaluate dogs‚Äô preference for petting or vocal praise and measured the initial choice, the time spent with each alternative, and the number of within-session alternations. We assessed dogs‚Äô preference for petting or vocal praise in (1) shelter dogs, (2) owned dogs with strangers providing both interactions, and (3) owned dogs with the dog's owner providing the interactions. Across all experimental groups, dogs preferred petting to vocal praise. We next assessed time spent with each alternative when only one alternative was available at a time in shelter dogs and owned dogs (Experiment 2). Shelter dogs were tested with a stranger and owned dogs were tested with their owners providing the interaction. Dogs alternated between petting and vocal praise, vocal praise and no interaction, or received only petting for eight 3-min sessions of each comparison. Both shelter and owned dogs spent significantly longer in proximity to the experimenter when the interaction was petting compared to vocal praise. Vocal praise produced as little proximity-seeking behavior as did no interaction. Additionally, dogs did not show any sign of satiation with petting across all eight sessions. Overall, petting seems to be an important interaction between dogs and humans that might maintain inter-specific social behavior but vocal praise likely has to be specifically conditioned.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Canine Behavior.","p. 47-59 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included"", ""l.c.blake""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: pass new rule",NA,Dogs,NA,NA

This study investigated the invasion of cacao agroforests by free-ranging dogs in Brazil. By monitoring the behavior of dogs using direct observations, we assessed whether direct (chasing and predation) and indirect (urine and fecal deposition) interactions with wildlife are more common when dogs enter the agroforests with humans than when they stay outside. We also compared the time that dogs spent inside versus outside the agroforests, and estimated their areas of use. The dogs (n = 10) spent a small fraction of the time without their owners, and only when moving inside the cacao agroforests. The dogs fed and rested more in open habitats and house surroundings than in agroforests, but they were more active and depredated wildlife exclusively in the latter. Kernel estimates of space use at the 50% and 95% levels ranged from 1 to 46 ha and 6 to 202 ha, respectively. Most of the area used by dogs was within cacao agroforest, while core areas were concentrated near human residences and in places of owner permanence in cacao agroforest. Human movement was a key determining factor in the use of space by the dogs. Changes to human behaviors toward their dogs must be considered if the direct and indirect impacts of dogs on wildlife are to be mitigated.","p. 1261-1269 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included"", ""l.c.blake""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: fails new rule",NA,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Dogs,NA,NA

Because of its origins, the popular belief is that Labrador retrievers are ‚Äúkeen water lovers.‚Äù However, the extent to which this is true, and whether recent selection pressures might have changed the breed is unknown. In this pilot work, we investigated the relative importance of water as a behavioral stimulus for the modern breed. The study was conducted in an arena with a swimming pool to evaluate differences in the frequency of approach behaviors and the duration of interaction behaviors toward 3 stimuli: water, dog, and human. The behaviors were measured during 2-minute periods for each Labrador retriever (N = 10), in 3 trials, with all the stimuli present at the same time in the arena. The dogs interacted significantly longer with the water stimulus than with the dog and the human stimuli. The median of the frequency of approach to the water stimulus was significantly different from the median frequency of approach to the dog stimulus. The water appeared to be a positive stimulus for this group of Labrador retrievers and the most appealing of the 3 stimuli in the specific test condition.

In the current study, we used a concurrent choice paradigm in which dogs could interact with two people, both of whom provided the same petting interaction, to test whether owned dogs would prefer their owner over a stranger and whether the familiarity of the testing context would influence preference. We also investigated whether shelter and owned dogs tested with two strangers would show a preference between strangers and whether that preference would be similar in magnitude to any preference between the owner and stranger. Owned dogs preferred to interact with their owners when in an unfamiliar context, but allocated more time to the stranger in a familiar context. Both shelter and owned dogs tested with two strangers showed a magnitude of preference for one stranger over the other similar to owned dogs' preference for owners in an unfamiliar context. These results parallel what has been found in strange situation tests with owned dogs tested with their owners, but the strength of preference shown for one of two strangers indicates dogs can form a preference for one person quickly.","305-317 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included"", ""l.c.blake""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: pass new rule",NA,Dogs,NA,NA

We used a preference test to measure proximity-seeking behaviours of 4-month-old family pigs and dogs in the presence of their caregiver and either a stranger or a familiar object, in a novel environment. We found that both pigs and dogs preferred their caregivers over the familiar object but not over the stranger. However, when the caregiver and the stranger were present, only dogs showed an overall preference for human proximity, and pigs spent more time away from both humans. These results suggest that both dogs and pigs seek the proximity of their caregiver, but there is a difference in how each species generalizes their experience to other humans. Species-specific predispositions, including that dogs have a longer socialization period and that humans are more salient as a social stimulus for them, may be important for the early development of an overall preference for humans.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included"", ""l.c.blake""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: pass new rule",NA,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Dogs;Swine,NA,NA

Of interest is whether attributions of understanding and emotions to dogs are sound, or are unwarranted applications of human psychological terms to non-humans. One attribution commonly made to dogs is that the ""guilty look"" shows that dogs feel guilt at doing a disallowed action. In the current study, this anthropomorphism is empirically tested. The behaviours of 14 domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) were videotaped over a series of trials and analyzed for elements that correspond to an owner-identified ""guilty look."" Trials varied the opportunity for dogs to disobey an owner's command not to eat a desirable treat while the owner was out of the room, and varied the owners' knowledge of what their dogs did in their absence. The results revealed no difference in behaviours associated with the guilty look. By contrast, more such behaviours were seen in trials when owners scolded their dogs. The effect of scolding was more pronounced when the dogs were obedient, not disobedient. These results indicate that a better description of the so-called guilty look is that it is a response to owner cues, rather than that it shows an appreciation of a misdeed. ¬© 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Thereby, we focused on the human‚Äìdog familiarity and the body area petted. The participating nine male and 15 female dogs were either familiar (familiar group) or unfamiliar (unfamiliar group) with the testperson. The testing procedure consisted of nine physical human‚Äìdog interactions applied in a random order, e.g. petting and holding the lying dog on the ground, holding a forepaw of the dog, petting the dog on its shoulder, and covering the dog's muzzle with one hand. The dogs were petted in a prescribed manner. A test sequence lasted for 30s and the inter-test sequence interval was set at 60s. The whole testing procedure was videotaped and the frequency and duration of the dogs‚Äô behavioural responses were analysed. For the non-invasive real-time measurement of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) the RS 810 Polar-Systems¬Æ was applied on the dog's chest.The mean HR (F1,197=15.32, P<0.001) and root mean square of successive heartbeat interval differences (RMSSD) response values (F1,204=12.11, P=0.001) differed significantly between the dog groups. The HR values of the familiar group were significantly higher compared to the baseline values (F1,23=13.42, P=0.001).

The dogs showed more appeasement gestures if the physiological parameters revealed an increased HR and decreased RMSSD value compared to the baseline values. Likewise, decreased RMSSD values were associated with an enhanced frequency of redirected behaviours.Our results point out that the assessment of dogs‚Äô behavioural and physiological responses during physical human‚Äìdog contact provide adequate information, whether the level of the dogs‚Äô emotional conflict might jeopardize the benefits associated with human‚Äìdog interactions.","p. 113-120 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs;Heart Rate;Emotions,NA,NA

Furthermore, pre-competition basal T in men on losing teams predicted more than half of the variance in dogs' cortisol change. This relationship was mediated through men's punitive and affiliative behaviors towards their dogs immediately after competition. Men's T change was also a significant predictor of dogs' change in cortisol such that men who experienced greater decreases in T after a loss were associated with dogs that experienced greater increases in cortisol. In winning teams, men's pre-competition T and T changes were unrelated to dogs' cortisol changes.

All dogs showed a pattern of attachment behaviours with their owners, as they played with and greeted the owner more than the stranger and remained oriented towards the door more in the presence of the stranger during the separation episodes. Furthermore, all groups engaged in play with the stranger more when their owner was present rather than absent (episode 2 vs. 3). The Trained group was less explorative than the Naive and Old groups. Trained dogs engaged in different behaviours not for playing purposes holding a ball in their mouth more than the other groups. Social play behaviours were expressed equally by the Trained and the Naive groups and less in the Old group.

The study consisted of two experimental conditions: a) ‚Äúcontact‚Äù - owner petting and talking to the dog during the examination; b) ‚Äúnon-contact‚Äù - owner present during the examination but not allowed to interact with the dog. Our findings showed that the veterinary examinations produced acute stress responses in dogs during both ‚Äúcontact‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-contact‚Äù conditions, with significant increases in lip licking, HR, and max OST. A significant decrease in attempts to jump off the examination table (p=0.002) was observed during the examination in the ‚Äúcontact‚Äù compared to the ‚Äúnon-contact‚Äù condition. In addition, interactions of owners showed an attenuating effect on HR (p=0.018) and max OST (p=0.011) in their dogs. The testing order (first vs. second visit) had no impact on behavioral and physiological parameters, suggesting that dogs did not habituate or sensitize to the examination procedure. Moreover, the duration of the owner-dog interactions had no significant impact on the behavioral and physiological responses of their dogs. This study demonstrates that owner-dog interactions improve the well-being of dogs during a veterinary examination. Future research may assist in further understanding the mechanisms associated with reducing stress in dogs in similar settings.","p. 270-281 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs,NA,NA

This study investigated human‚Äìdog interactions when volunteers take shelter dogs for an on-leash walk, using video recording and a canine leash tension meter. Male dogs tended to pull more frequently and created higher leash tensions than female dogs. Dogs displayed more stress related behaviours when interacting with men than women, with the signs including spending less time holding the tail in a high position, and more frequent gazing and lip-licking behaviours. Finally, during the walk, there was a greater pre-disposition in women to use verbal commands and language typically associated with talking to babies, while men were more inclined to have physical contact with the dogs. These results may be used to match shelter dogs with appropriate men and women volunteers for dog walking exercise, and to improve potential socialisation of the dogs before rehoming.AbstractPrevious studies have indicated that human gender and canine sex influences human‚Äìdog interactions. However, the majority of studies have considered the interaction when dogs were off-leash and the behavioural interactions when dogs are walked on a leash have not been addressed. This study investigated human‚Äìdog interactions when shelter volunteers take shelter dogs for an on-leash walk. Video records were made of 370 walks, involving 74 volunteers and 111 shelter dogs, and a leash tension meter was used to determine the pull strength of dogs and walkers. Human gender and canine sex had dyadic effects during the walk. Male dogs tended to pull more frequently and created increased leash tensions. Dogs displayed more stress related behaviours when interacting with men than women, with the signs being spending less time holding the tail in the high position, and more frequent gazing and lip-licking behaviours. Finally, there was a greater pre-disposition in women to use verbal commands, and language typically used with babies, while men were more inclined to have physical contact with dogs.

","Measures of behavioral responses and cardiovascular parameters to evaluate and assess animal well-being are well established. A major aspect of companion animal well-being seems to originate from direct human‚Äìanimal interaction. For pet dogs, the manner in which they obtain and respond to petting and hugs could interfere with the development of a pleasant human‚Äìdog companionship. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate cardiovascular responses by dogs to physical human‚Äìdog contact and to assess these physiological responses in relation to the dogs' behavioral responses. Noninvasive measurements of privately owned dogs' (N = 28) cardiovascular parameters and behavioral responses were carried out during 9 physical human‚Äìdog interactions (e.g., petting the dog on its back, holding a forepaw of the dog). The behavioral responses were grouped in categories, for example, redirected behavior, displacement activity, and appeasement gesture. The mean heart rate (HR) and 2 cardiac activity parameters, standard deviation of normal-to-normal R‚ÄìR intervals (SDNN) and root mean square of successive heartbeat interval differences/SDNN (RMSSD/SDNN) ratio, differed significantly among the human‚Äìdog interactions. Petting and holding the dog around the head was associated with an increased SDNN. An increased vagal tone was the dogs' responses to being petted at the chest. Displacement activities correlated negatively with all cardiovascular parameters (HR, SDNN, RMSSD, and RMSSD/SDNN ratio). Appeasement gestures were positively correlated with HR and occurred less under an increased vagal tone. The behavioral strategies, that is, freezing (standing motionless with all legs on the floor) and withdrawal (moving backward without any agonistic display) were negatively associated with the cardiac activity parameters, RMSSD and RMSSD/SDNN ratio. The dogs' behavioral and physiological responses suggest that some common physical human‚Äìdog interactions perceived as unpleasant by dogs. Emphasis on human signaling in human‚Äìdog interactions encourages development of recommendations for pleasant and safe human‚Äìdog contact to enhance dogs' well-being and the human‚Äìdog relationship.","p. 93-97 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Dogs,NA,NA

The role of canine personality on this predisposition is unknown. This study used a test where dogs encountered an unsolvable problem. The aim of the study was to understand whether dog personalities could predict their tendency to look at the owner, approach and engage with the task, and show distress during the task. We also compared dogs with life experience in Animal Assistance Interventions and dogs with no work, training, or sport experience. The results indicate that the dogs with a personality more sensitive to uncertain situations looked at the owner more and engaged less often with the task, suggesting they were expecting directions from the owner. Dogs with a personality more sensitive to obtaining rewards and avoiding punishment looked at the owner less often. Dogs with a high tendency to avoid punishment also abandoned and returned more often to the task, possibly as a sign of frustration. Finally, Animal-Assisted Intervention dogs looked more at the owner and had fewer task orientations, confirming the enhancing effect on looking. As personality differences reflect genetic predispositions, it is very important to know the role of personality on cognitive traits that are important to dogs that work and collaborate with humans.AbstractDogs are biologically predisposed to communicate with humans in cooperative contexts. They show individual differences in dog‚Äìhuman communication and inhibition, potentially enhanced by life experience, e.g., Animal-Assisted Interventions. This study aimed to investigate whether dogs‚Äô personality, defined by biologically meaningful neural circuits described in the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory of Personality (RST), predicted dogs‚Äô communication, task orientation, emotional state, and approach of an unsolvable task. We also investigated the differences between dogs experienced in Animal-Assisted Interventions (AAI) and inexperienced dogs. The results indicated that a high sensitivity to the RST personality trait related to managing uncertainty (Behavioural Inhibition System, BIS) predicted fewer task orientations but increased referential and non-referential looking, which we interpreted as a way to obtain directions from the owner. Conversely, a high sensitivity to the traits reflecting tendencies to approach rewards (Behavioural Approach System, BAS) and avoid punishment (Fight‚ÄìFlight‚ÄìFreeze System, FFFS) predicted lower looking. High sensitivity to the FFFS also predicted more frequent task orientations, which we interpreted as frustration. Finally, the dogs in the AAI program looked more at their owner and were less oriented towards the task. These results provide empirical evidence of individual differences tied to the psychobiological personality traits in canine cognitive skills. Understanding such cognitive profiles may have an enormous impact on activities that rely upon dog‚Äìhuman collaborative interaction.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs;Animals;Animal Shells,NA,NA

The Wilcoxon test revealed significant differences between owner and stranger for protest at separation (whining), contact maintenance effect (proximity, attention seeking and physical contact) and secure base effect (exploration, individual play and social play). The results suggest that dogs behave similarly to children towards the mothers and to chimpanzees towards human caretakers in the Ainsworth Strange Situation Test: owners are the preferred recipient of affiliative behaviours and, in their absence, dogs show behaviours indicative of distress. After reunion with the owner, dogs show an increase in social behaviours towards him/her. Dogs did not show fear of the stranger, and it was regarded as a normal behaviour for adult well-socialized dogs. Until now whether owners represented a secure base for their dogs was debated, due to controversial results. This study found that dogs play and explore more when owners were present, suggesting that owners can represent a secure base for their dogs. Therefore, according to Bowlby's definition, dogs are linked to their owners by an attachment bond.","1275-1294 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs,NA,NA

Box 338, 6700 AH, Wageningen, the Netherlands. , Utrecht University Animal Behaviour Group, Department of Animals in Science and Society, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Yalelaan 2, 3584CM, Utrecht, the Netherlands. ","Dog-directed parenting is an aspect of the owner-dog relationship that describes the overarching emotional sphere in which the dog‚Äôs guidance and training take place. How dog-directed parenting styles express in specific owner-dog interactions is presently unknown. However, such knowledge can help to advise dog owners on appropriate parenting of their dog. Child-directed parenting is regarded appropriate when it is demanding for socially adaptive behaviour as well as responsive to the child‚Äôs needs. This combination of high demandingness and responsiveness is known as authoritative parenting, which in dog-directed parenting manifests in two ways. Teaching the dog socially adaptive behaviour is key to the authoritative-training style (AUT) and being responsive to the dog‚Äôs perceived needs and emotions is key to the authoritative-intrinsic style (AUI). A third dog-directed parenting style, the authoritarian-correction style (AUC), of high demandingness and low responsiveness focusses on correcting the dog‚Äôs undesired behaviour. We determined these three dog-directed parenting styles by an online questionnaire and tested the styles for associations with owner and dog behaviours. The behaviours were scored as the owner-dog dyads walked a short course with distractions (treats and balls) that dogs should ignore (N = 40) or when they had a ten-minute break together (N = 36). Nine out of 49 behavioural observations, such as verbally praising or correcting the dog and leash tensions, related significantly (comparison-wise two-tailed P < 0.05) to the parenting styles and Spearman rank correlations explained up to 30 % of the variance. The self-report-based dog-directed parenting styles related logically to the way owners actually interacted with their dogs, verbally and by leash. AUI and AUT parenting related directly to verbally praising the dog. AUC parenting related directly to verbally correcting the dog and to leash tensions. Also, AUC parenting related inversely and AUT parenting directly to the dog frequently looking at its owner during the course with distractions. Thus, we find evidence that verbal communication and leash tensions are telling about dog-directed parenting styles and, possibly, constitute meaningful manifestations to address in educational interventions for dog owners. We see potential merit in moving AUC parenting dog owners away from leash-related guidance towards verbal praise-based guidance and a more authoritative dog-directed parenting style.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs,NA,NA

","The aim of our study was to examine the influence of dyadic attachment, owner and dog personality, and owner gender on stress hormone dynamics in owner‚Äìdog dyads. We hypothesized that owner personality modulates dyadic relationships and, hence, would affect the cortisol levels resulting from acute and chronic stressors. Data were collected during three meetings with 10 male and 12 female owners aged 23‚Äì68 years, with their medium-to-large, intact male dogs aged 1.5‚Äì6.0 years. These owner-dog dyads were observed and video-taped during different tasks. The NEO-FFI (Five-Factor Inventory) was used to determine owner personality, and questionnaires covering owner‚Äìdog relationship and attachment were employed. Salivary cortisol levels were measured from samples collected during the dyads' daily routine and after experimental challenges. It was found that our experimental tasks had little effect on the salivary cortisol levels of either dog or owner except that dogs and male owners showed elevated levels during the first 20 minutes of our visit to their homes. However, owners who scaled high in neuroticism (NEO-FFI dimension 1) or low in conscientiousness (NEO-FFI dimension 5) showed high morning salivary cortisol values, in contrast to their dogs, which were low in morning salivary cortisol. In general, dogs of owners who considered them as being ‚Äúsocial partners‚Äù and ‚Äúmeaningful companions‚Äù showed low morning salivary cortisol values. We conclude that the main individual and dyadic factors for stress coping in owner‚Äìdog dyads are owner personality, relationship with the dog, and attachment to the dog, and that relationship had generally a greater effect on dog cortisol levels than our experimental tasks.","p. 199-214 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Hydrocortisone;Dogs,NA,NA

To clarify the role of life experience, we tested pet dogs and found that oxytocin concentrations correlated positively with physical contact with their owners, while glucocorticoids remained unaffected. Results show that, given similar experiences, wolf-dog differences in human-directed sociability and associated hormones are subtle and indicate that factors related to life as a pet dog rather than domestication account for oxytocin release during human‚Äìdog interactions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Dogs;Life Change Events;Oxytocin;MSH Release-Inhibiting Hormone,NA,NA

Video-recording started 10min before the owner left the house and continued until 10min after the owner returned, so that interactions between dog and owner as well as behaviour during separation could be studied.

This study used a trapped-other paradigm, modified from use in research on rats, to study prosocial helping in dogs. A human trapped behind a door either cried or hummed, and the dog‚Äôs behavioral and physiological responses (i.e., door opening and heart rate variability) were recorded. Then, dogs participated in an impossible task to evaluate gaze at the owner as a measure of the strength of their relationship with their owner. Dogs in the distress condition opened at the same frequency, but significantly more quickly, than dogs in the control condition. In the distress condition, the dogs that opened showed lower levels of stress and were able to suppress their own distress response, thus enabling them to open the door more quickly. In the control condition, opening was not related to the dog‚Äôs stress level and may have instead been motivated by curiosity or a desire for social contact. Results from the impossible task suggest that openers in the distress condition may have a stronger bond with their owner than non-openers, while non-openers in the control condition showed a stronger bond than openers, which may further suggest that the trapped-other paradigm is reflective of empathy.","374-386 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs,NA,NA

However, the extent to which a companion dog responds to human emotions, such as stress, remains to be understood. This study examines whether a companion dog‚Äôs stress, as measured by cortisol levels and heart rate, increases during a familiar outdoor walk in response to its owner‚Äôs experience of stress. Sixty-eight owner/dog dyads participated in this study. The dyads were randomly assigned to an Experimental or Control group. Owners in the Experimental group were informed the walk would be digitally recorded for subsequent evaluation of their handling skills, whereas those in the Control group were informed the walk would be digitally recorded for archival purposes (no evaluation). This manipulation was implemented to induce a mild stress response in the owners. Salivary cortisol samples were collected from the owner and their dog before and after the walk. The dyad was also fitted with monitoring devices to record heart rate throughout the walk. Finally, personality information regarding the owner and their dog was collected. We found that cortisol production within the dyad showed a marginal inverse correlation. We also found that owners‚Äô Openness to Experience and dogs‚Äô Fearfulness influenced the heart rate of the other during the first minute of a walk. These results support that although stress may be detected within a dyad, this does not result in an associated significant change in cortisol or heart rate.","239-250 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs;Walking,NA,NA

","The bond dogs develop with their owner received increased attention in the last years but no study aimed at characterizing the way in which owners interact with their dogs in their daily life and how this might influence dog behavior. In order to examine how dog owners interact with their dogs, we first analyzed the behavior of 220 dog owners in 8 different standardized situations involving the owner-dog dyad. We extracted 3 behavioral factors related to ""Owner Warmth,"" ""Owner Social Support,"" and ""Owner Control."" Further, we investigated whether owner personality, gender and age are associated with these three factors. Results indicated that older owners scored lower in ""Owner Warmth"" and in ""Owner Social Support"" and higher in ""Owner Control"" than younger owners. Furthermore, owners scoring high in ""Owner Control"" scored lower in the personality trait Openness and owners scoring high in ""Owner Social Support"" scored lower in the personality trait Conscientiousness. Finally, we also analyzed whether the dogs' reaction to an unfamiliar woman's threatening approach was associated with the owners' interaction styles. Results showed that dogs that searched for proximity of their owners during the threatening situation had owners scoring higher in ""Owner Warmth,"" as compared to dogs that reacted more autonomously, approaching the unfamiliar experimenter. Analogies between dog-owner interaction styles and human parenting styles are discussed considering the implications of the present findings for human social psychology as well as the practical relevance for dog welfare and human safety.","1979 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs,NA,NA

In this study, we examine possible links between the types of games played and dimensions of the dog-owner relationship that are generally considered to affect such problems. Fifty dog-owner partnerships were filmed during 3-min play sessions in which the owner was allowed to choose the games played. All partnerships then undertook a 1-hr test designed to measure elements of behavior commonly ascribed to ""dominance"" and ""attachment."" Principal components analysis of the data produced 2 dominance-related factors (Amenability and Confident Interactivity) and 4 factors describing aspects of attachment (Nonspecific Attention Seeking, Preference for Owner, Preference for Unfamiliar Person, and Separation-Related Behavior). Amenability, in particular, varied significantly between breeds. In the study, we then compared types of games played to each of these factors. Dogs playing rough-and-tumble scored higher for Amenability and lower on Separation-Related Behavior than did dogs playing other types of games. Dogs playing tug-of-war and fetch scored high on Confident Interactivity. Winning or losing these games had no consistent effect on their test scores. If the dog started the majority of the games, the dog was significantly less amenable and more likely to exhibit aggression. The results suggest that how dogs play reflects general attributes of their temperament and relationship with their owner. This study provides no evidence that games play a major deterministic role on dominance dimensions of dog-human relationships, but the results suggest that playing games involving considerable body contact may affect attachment dimensions.","p. 67-94 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Dogs,NA,NA

Subjects were divided qualitatively into four categories according to their interactional behaviour during the first two days ('dog-oriented', 'human-oriented', 'dog & human friendly', 'asocial'). This classification was compared to an independent division resulting from statistical analysis of the dogs' entry-sequences, and was found to be consistent for 80 per cent of dogs. One week after entry, both female and male dogs received distinctively fewer social interactions by conspecifics and tended to direct more interaction-initiating behaviour towards the keeper, thus demonstrating an integration process; females became more physically active and initiated significantly more interactions with other dogs; for males, the contrary was found. Qualitative comparison between first visitors and regular guests suggest that experienced dogs integrate faster, showing fewer behavioural signs of distress and engaging more often in investigatory behaviour. Results indicate that the assessment of dogs from their behaviour during the entry-sequence is a valid method to predict later tendencies. Males and females should be handled differently during introduction. The stress of entry into an existing group can therefore be reduced, improving the animals' welfare.","391-404 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs,NA,NA

It has been developed from the Ainsworth Strange Situation Procedure, which is used extensively to investigate attachment between children and their parents. In this experiment, 12 female beagle dogs were tested in two treatments to identify possible order effects in the test, a potential weakness in the SSP. In one treatment (FS), dogs participated together with a ‚Äòfamiliar person‚Äô and a ‚Äòstranger‚Äô. In a control treatment (SS), the same dogs participated together with two unfamiliar people, ‚Äòstranger A‚Äô and ‚Äòstranger B‚Äô. Comparisons were made between episodes within as well as between treatments. As predicted in FS, dogs explored more in the presence of the familiar person than the stranger. Importantly, they also explored more in the presence of stranger A (who appeared in the same order as the familiar person and followed the same procedure) than stranger B in SS. Furthermore, comparisons between treatments, where a familiar person was present in FS and stranger A was present in SS, showed no differences in exploration. In combination, these results indicate that the effect of a familiar person on dogs' exploratory behaviour, a key feature when assessing secure attachment styles, could not be tested reliably due to the order in which the familiar person and the stranger appear. It is proposed that in the future only counterbalanced versions of the SSP are used. Alternatively, since dogs reliably initiated more contact with the familiar person compared to the strangers, it is suggested that future studies on attachment in dogs towards humans should focus either on the behaviour of the dog in those episodes of the SSP when the person returns, or on reunion behaviour in other studies, specially designed to address dog-human interactions at this time.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Dogs,NA,NA

We presented morph videos of the caregiver, a familiar person, and a stranger showing either happy or angry facial expressions. Regardless of emotion, viewing the caregiver activated brain regions associated with emotion and attachment processing in humans. In contrast, the stranger elicited activation mainly in brain regions related to visual and motor processing, and the familiar person relatively weak activations overall. While the majority of happy stimuli led to increased activation of the caudate nucleus associated with reward processing, angry stimuli led to activations in limbic regions. Both the eye-tracking and preference test data supported the superior role of the caregiver‚Äôs face and were in line with the findings from the fMRI experiment.

The response of 30 dogs housed in the Ulster Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (USPCA) to each of six people (three men and three women), who stood individually for a period of 2 min at the front of the dog's cage, was observed. The amount of time that the dog spent at the front of the cage, barking, looking towards the human, wagging its tail, and engaged in activities of sitting, standing, moving, resting, was recorded.

The mutually advantageous social contact between dogs and humans is facilitated by effective mechanisms that negotiate ongoing interactions and avoid the escalation of conflicts. We investigated the reaction of 37 family dogs towards the approaching owner and experimenter who communicated either threat or friendliness both in playful and non-playful situations. Dogs' behavioural responses were in accordance with the conflicting (threatening) and non-conflicting (friendly) manner of the approaching humans both in the non-playful and the playful situations. The familiarity of the interacting human partner (owner or experimenter) affected the behaviour of dogs only in the non-playful situations, where contact-seeking was less typical and gaze-averting tendencies were more pronounced towards the experimenter. The threatening approach elicited tolerant/contact-seeking reactions towards the owner in both situations and also towards the experimenter in the playful situation. But dogs were avoidant/aggressive with the experimenter in the non-playful situation. Play bows were triggered by both human partners' threatening approach, but only in the playful situation. Results suggest that this signal appears when the human partners' behaviour becomes ambiguous in relation to the social context. We propose that the flexible utilization of various conflict-resolving behaviours depending on the actual partners represent fundamental elements of dogs' social competence.

However, the proximal neural mechanisms driving dog-human social interaction are unknown. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in 15 awake dogs to probe the neural basis for their preferences for social interaction and food reward. In a first experiment, we used the ventral caudate as a measure of intrinsic reward value and compared activation to conditioned stimuli that predicted food, praise or nothing. Relative to the control stimulus, the caudate was significantly more active to the reward-predicting stimuli and showed roughly equal or greater activation to praise vs food in 13 of 15 dogs. To confirm that these differences were driven by the intrinsic value of social praise, we performed a second imaging experiment in which the praise was withheld on a subset of trials. The difference in caudate activation to the receipt of praise, relative to its withholding, was strongly correlated with the differential activation to the conditioned stimuli in the first experiment. In a third experiment, we performed an out-of-scanner choice task in which the dog repeatedly selected food or owner in a Y-maze. The relative caudate activation to food- and praise-predicting stimuli in Experiment 1 was a strong predictor of each dog's sequence of choices in the Y-maze. Analogous to similar neuroimaging studies of individual differences in human social reward, our findings demonstrate a neural mechanism for preference in domestic dogs that is stable within, but variable between, individuals. Moreover, the individual differences in the caudate responses indicate the potentially higher value of social than food reward for some dogs and may help to explain the apparent efficacy of social interaction in dog training.","1853-1862 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Food,NA,NA

The current study, which involved AAI for youth with developmental disabilities and their family dog, aimed to determine if the dog's style of attachment to a primary adult caretaker in the home was predictive of dog-child attachment style pre-and post-intervention. Using a Secure Base Test (SBT), the attachment style of the family dog toward an adult owner/parent was evaluated, and the attachment style of the dog toward the participating child was assessed before and after the dog-assisted interventions. The dog's attachment style to the child was then compared to the dog-parent attachment style. The findings show that all dogs with a secure attachment to the child at the initial assessment also had a secure attachment to the parent. It was also demonstrated that AAI has the potential to change the attachment style between a family dog and child to a more secure attachment, and that the dog-parent attachment style is a significant predictor of which dogs were able to develop a secure attachment to the child over the course of the AAI.","566910 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Animals;Dogs;Animal Shells,NA,NA

Over a 30‚Äêday period, one group of dogs received the supplement, and another group a placebo.Twelve behavioural variables were recorded in a series of four subtests (ST1‚ÄêST4) on days 0, 15 and 30. Saliva cortisol levels were measured before and after each set of STs.ResultsThe dogs rated as more fearful displayed significantly higher cortisol values before the day 0 test session, were less active, spent less time playing with the experimenter, and approached the unfamiliar object less frequently. The owners did not correctly guess whether their dog had received the supplement or not. Behaviours of dogs were significantly different across the three sessions, with significant increases of stress‚Äêrelated behaviours (time spent in the door zone, number of interactions with the door, of whining, and of lip‚Äêlicking). Conversely time spent with the experimenter increased, interactions and curiosity for the novel object and play with the experimenter decreased, presumably due to a habituation process. This suggests that the design of the four subtests session was relevant to test for mild stressors situations. Moreover, supplemented and placebo dogs responded differently to the three test sessions, indicating a supplement effect on dogs' behaviours and their adaptation to mild stressors situations.ConclusionThe trial results suggested that the supplement facilitates activity and curiosity in a familiar environment, promotes dog‚Äêhuman interactions with an increased human familiarity, and tends to reduce subtle stress behaviours.

However, due to the genetic relatedness of infants and their mothers, it is difficult to separate the genetic effects of infants' OXTR genotype from the environmental effects of mothers' genotype possibly affecting their parental behavior. The apparent functional analogy between child-parent and dog-owner relationship, however, offers a way to disentangle the effects of these factors because pet dogs are not genetically related to their caregivers. In the present study we investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms of pet dogs' OXTR gene (-213AG,-94TC,-74CG) and their owners' OXTR gene (rs53576, rs1042778, rs2254298) are associated with components of dog-owner attachment. In order to investigate whether social-environmental effects modulate the potential genetic influence on attachment, dogs and their owners from two different countries (Austria and Hungary, N = 135 in total) were tested in a modified version of the Ainsworth Strange Situation Test (SST) and questionnaires were also used to collect information about owner personality and attachment style. We coded variables related to three components of attachment behavior in dogs: their sensitivity to the separation from and interaction with the owner (Attachment), stress caused by the unfamiliar environment (Anxiety), and their responsiveness to the stranger (Acceptance). We found that (1) dogs' behavior was significantly associated with polymorphisms in both dogs' and owners' OXTR gene, (2) SNPs in dogs' and owners' OXTR gene interactively influenced dog-human relationship, (3) dogs' attachment behavior was affected by the country of origin, and (4) it was related to their owners' personality as well as attachment style. Thus, the present study provides evidence, for the first time, that both genetic variation in the OXTR gene and various aspects of pet dogs' environmental background are associated with their attachment to their human caregivers.","435 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,"Dogs;Polymorphism, Genetic;MSH Release-Inhibiting Hormone;Oxytocin",NA,NA

The domestic dog is an interesting subject in this line of research as it lives in the human environment and regularly interacts with numerous humans, yet it often has a particularly close relationship with its owner. Therefore, we investigated how long dogs (Canis familiaris) would attend to the actions of two familiar humans and one unfamiliar experimenter, while varying whether dogs had a close relationship with only one or both familiar humans.

Finland","Appropriate response to companions‚Äô emotional signals is important for all social creatures. The emotional expressions of humans and non-human animals have analogies in their form and function, suggesting shared evolutionary roots, but very little is known about how animals other than primates view and process facial expressions. In primates, threat-related facial expressions evoke exceptional viewing patterns compared with neutral or positive stimuli. Here, we explore if domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) have such an attentional bias toward threatening social stimuli and whether observed emotional expressions affect dogs‚Äô gaze fixation distribution among the facial features (eyes, midface and mouth). We recorded the voluntary eye gaze of 31 domestic dogs during viewing of facial photographs of humans and dogs with three emotional expressions (threatening, pleasant and neutral). We found that dogs‚Äô gaze fixations spread systematically among facial features. The distribution of fixations was altered by the seen expression, but eyes were the most probable targets of the first fixations and gathered longer looking durations than mouth regardless of the viewed expression. The examination of the inner facial features as a whole revealed more pronounced scanning differences among expressions. This suggests that dogs do not base their perception of facial expressions on the viewing of single structures, but the interpretation of the composition formed by eyes, midface and mouth. Dogs evaluated social threat rapidly and this evaluation led to attentional bias, which was dependent on the depicted species: threatening conspecifics‚Äô faces evoked heightened attention but threatening human faces instead an avoidance response. We propose that threatening signals carrying differential biological validity are processed via distinctive neurocognitive pathways. Both of these mechanisms may have an adaptive significance for domestic dogs. The findings provide a novel perspective on understanding the processing of emotional expressions and sensitivity to social threat in non-primates.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs,NA,NA

Domestic dogs are one of the most commonly used animals for these kinds of interventions, given their trainability and the positive effects of dog-human interactions. Nevertheless, the selection of participating animals is mainly unsystematic, and training is not required for dogs to take part in AAAs. Previous studies suggest that high sociability as well as reduced fear and aggression are desirable traits in AAA dogs. Yet, to our knowledge, there are no previous studies assessing the specific characteristics of dogs participating in AAAs. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of AAA and pet dogs (PDs) that live in the same household but do not participate in AAAs. We assessed 17 dogs (9 participating in AAAs in hospital settings and 8 pets living in the same household‚Äìcontrol group) with a test battery comprising 3 behavioral tasks (sociability test, gazing test, and A-not-B task), and owner-rated questionnaires (Dog Impulsivity Assessment Scale [DIAS] and 4 subscales: trainability, fear to strangers, nonsocial fear, and attachment/attention seeking of the Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire [C-BARQ]). Results of the gazing test indicate that, when dogs were not reinforced for looking at the human face, AAA dogs gazed longer at an unknown experimenter than PDs. Therefore, they showed an increased tendency to gaze at humans and persist on this communicative attempt when this response was not successful. Additionally, according to the DIAS score, AAA dogs would be less impulsive than the control group. No significant differences were found on the A-not-B task, the sociability test, or the C-BARQ. In conclusion, since these AAA dogs had not undergone specific training, the effects observed in the present work may be attributed, at least partially, to the learning experiences they had during AAA work. Overall, it would be important to take into account these characteristics for both the selection and training of these animals.","p. 76-81 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs;Animals;Animal Shells,NA,NA

In the presence of a human, dogs of the Arkansas Line of Nervous Pointers show markedly reduced activity. In close quarters, where they cannot flee, they usually react to humans by freezing. These responses do not extinguish. The breed demonstrates a strong capacity to inhibit motion. In our nervous dogs, this trait is greatly exaggerated. In the search for an objective and rapidly modifiable target motor sign to correlate with biochemical and pharmacological events, we discovered that 10 of 10 nervous dogs, in contrast to kennel mates of a normal line, developed tonic immobility (TI) which was induced by manual inversion into a sling and stroking. This is the first systematic demonstration of TI in mature dogs. The TI was accompanied by reduced telemetered heart rate (HR) compared to baseline. Release from the inverted position was accompanied by marked HR increase. In the absence of humans, both before and after the inversion, all nervous dogs showed little or no movement about the testing area. This was in contrast to the nine normal line dogs, which were comparable in age and sex. These normal dogs were very active before and after inversion into the sling. Five of the normals remained in the sling but did not show head and neck immobility and were generally relaxed. Their HRs increased slightly while in the inverted position, thereafter returning to baseline. The four normals which righted themselves soon after the inversion showed reduced HR with the resumed activity. We discuss possible mechanisms and review some of the implications for psychiatry and behavioral biology.","605-613 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs,NA,NA

","Oxytocin (OT) is involved in multiple social bonds, from attachment between parents and offspring to ""friendships"". Dogs are an interesting species in which to investigate the link between the oxytocinergic system and social bonds since they establish preferential bonds with their own species but also with humans. Studies have shown that the oxytocinergic system may be involved in the regulation of such inter-specific relationships, with both dogs and their owners showing an increase in OT levels following socio-positive interactions. However, no direct comparison has been made in dogs' OT reactivity following a social interaction with the owner vs. a familiar (but not bonded) person, so it is unclear whether relationship type mediates OT release during socio-positive interactions or whether the interaction per se is sufficient. Here we investigated OT reactivity in both dogs and owners, following a socio-positive interaction with each other or a familiar partner. Results showed neither the familiarity with the partner, nor the type of interaction affected OT reactivity (as measured in urine) in either dogs or owners. Given the recent mixed results on the role of oxytocin in dog-human interactions, we suggest there is a need for greater standardization of methodologies, an assessment of overall results taking into account 'publication bias' issues, and further studies investigating the role of relationship quality and interaction type on OT release.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs;Oxytocin;MSH Release-Inhibiting Hormone,NA,NA

Guide dogs were intermediate between these two extremes, expressing their attachment to the owners but showing a more controlled emotional reaction. This finding suggests that guide dogs can be viewed as ""working pets"".

However, the interplay between sociability and conflict behaviour has rarely been investigated. Moreover, while many studies have addressed aggression in domestic dogs, alternative, non-aggressive conflict resolution strategies have received less scientific attention. Here we tested 134 Border collie puppies, aged 40‚Äì50 days, in a personality test which included friendly interactions with an unfamiliar person, exposure to a novel object, and three brief restraint tests. Considering the latter to be mild ‚Äòconflict‚Äô situations, we analysed whether the puppies‚Äô behaviour in the restraint tests was related to their sociability or to their boldness towards the novel object. Strategies employed by the puppies during restraint tests included trying to interact socially with the experimenter, remaining passive, and attempting to move away. In line with findings from humans and goats, puppies scoring high on sociability were more likely to adopt an interactive conflict resolution strategy, while those with low sociability scores tended to react passively. In contrast, avoidance behaviours were unrelated to sociability, possibly reflecting inconsistency in the flight strategy in dogs. Boldness towards a novel object was not related to sociability or to puppies‚Äô reactions in restraint tests.

","The human-animal relationship frequently involves physical touch, and this may have benefits for both participants. Grooming of horses at the withers has a calming effect on recipients, a phenomenon regularly used to reward horses. No studies on the effect on heart rate of grooming in different anatomical areas have been conducted in dogs, even though they are often given physical contact as a putative reinforcer. Kennelled Greyhounds (n = 16) and guide dogs (Golden Retrievers, Labrador Retrievers and their crosses, n = 12) were stroked for eight minutes using a grooming device in each of four areas in random order. These sites were selected on the basis of their being innervated by the dorsal branches of the spinal nerves, lateral branches of the spinal nerves, ventral branches of the spinal nerves and the caudal nerves. Heart rate measurements were taken every 30 seconds using an ECG recorder. There were no observed differences in the mean heart rate based on the region of the body groomed (p = 0.893), nor was any interaction of any other factor with area of the body significant (all p > 0.5). However, for all dogs, there was a highly significant trend (overall reduction) over time (p < 0.001), and Greyhounds had consistently higher mean heart rates than guide dogs (p < 0.001). Within Greyhounds, groomed dogs had significantly lower mean heart rates than non-groomed animals (n = 8, p = 0.003). That is, grooming had a substantial effect on reducing heat rate, but the area of the body where grooming was conducted was not important. In addition, males had consistently lower heart rates than females (p < 0.001). If having a reduced heart rate is a sign of reduced stress, then we can assume that non-invasive interventions that have this effect are reinforcing. The extent to which all dogs are reinforced by physical contact depends on their socialization and familiarity with personnel. The intrinsic reinforcing value of physical contact for dogs seems likely to be outweighed by its effect as a secondary reinforcer.","p. 236-244 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Heart Rate,NA,NA

The aim of this study was to determine if quality of attachment affects the performance of dog and owner dyads showed on an Obstacle Course. Modified Ainsworth's Strange Situation Test was used for assessing attachment quality. Only one dimension of the attachment, the 'anxiety' factor was found to correlate with behavioural measures of the Obstacle Course (e.g. number of mistakes, initialisation index that reflects which participant initiates more actions in a dyad). We found significant differences of performance between the three groups of dog-owner pairs (pet dog, guide dog and police dog dyads), but we could not show significant differences in the 'attachment' factor among these groups. We concluded that it is not the attachment type that causes the main differences in the leading behaviour of our three study groups. Dogs have an innate ability for cooperation with humans that was enhanced by selective breeding during domestication and this basic ability can be modified by training but seem to be less affected by the relationship with the owner.","p. 537-550 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Dogs,NA,NA

We carried out two studies to examine interspecific signalling when humans play with domestic dogs, Canis familiaris. In the first, we recorded dog-owner play sessions on video to identify actions used by 21 dog owners to initiate play with their dogs. Thirty-five actions were each used by three or more owners. These included postures, vocalizations and physical contact with the dog. The actions varied greatly in their apparent success at instigating play which was, surprisingly, unrelated to the frequency with which they were used. We then did an experiment to determine the effect of composites of commonly used signals upon the behaviour of 20 Labrador retrievers. The performance of both 'Bow' and 'Lunge' by a human altered the subsequent behaviour of the dogs. Both signals caused increases in play, and Lunge produced significant increases in play bout frequency and mean bout duration. The efficiency of both these postural signals was enhanced when they were accompanied by play vocalizations. Thus, specific actions used by humans do communicate a playful context to dogs and can be described as interspecific play signals.

It is widely recommended to use desensitization and counter-conditioning training to reduce this fear. However, the efficacy of this method for reducing veterinary fear has not been examined. We assessed the effect of a standardized four-week training program on behavioural and physiological signs of fear in dogs with pre-existing veterinary fear. Owned dogs were randomly allocated to receive training (n = 15) or no training (n = 22; Control). Owners of dogs in the training group were instructed to perform exam-style handling on their dog and to visit the veterinary clinic weekly. Owners of control dogs were given no instructions. Fear responses were assessed before and after the training period by a blinded observer during clinic arrival and examination. Despite motivated owners volunteering to participate in the current study, 44% of owners were non-compliant to this training program. During examination, control dogs had higher odds (95% confidence Interval (CI)) of reduced posture compared to trained dogs (Odds ratio (OR): 3.79, CI: 1.03‚Äì16.3). Fear scores for trained dogs lowered during the second examination (p = 0.046), and 86.7% of dog owners reported a reduction in their dog‚Äôs fear levels across the training period (p = 0.007). When entering the clinic (p = 0.002) and during examination (p = 0.002), trained female dogs had a higher rate of lip licking than control females. The training program did not influence temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, avoidance, trembling, vocalizations, or willingness and encouragement to step on the scale.

However, such classification for dogs has never been corroborated by the simultaneous analysis of quantitative measures of behavior recorded during the Strange Situation Procedure (SSP). Since several modified SSPs have been used to investigate dog-to-owner attachment, in this study, two different groups of dog-owner dyads underwent two different versions of the SSP. Dogs were classified based on their attachment pattern toward the owner. For this purpose, we developed a new adaptation of the classification used for human infants. In addition, dogs‚Äô behavior was recorded throughout the test. Behavioral differences between dogs classified as secure and avoidant were investigated. Results suggest that the classification used was effective at identifying secure and avoidant attachment styles in dogs. Like in children, behavioral differences between secure and avoidant dogs were particularly evident as the test progressed. While secure dogs showed an increase in proximity/contact seeking behaviors toward their owners, avoidant dogs did not. Larger samples may be needed in future studies to support these findings and to be able to include also ambivalent and disorganized dogs.AbstractSince several modified Strange Situation Procedures (SSP) have been used to investigate dog-to-owner attachment, in this study two different samples of dog-owner dyads underwent two modified versions of the SSP. Dogs‚Äô attachment style to the owner was assessed based on a novel adaptation of the attachment pattern classification used for infant-caregivers. Dogs‚Äô behavioral data were collected using continuous sampling and, in the second protocol, also with a scoring system for greeting and social play. In both studies, secure and avoidant dogs‚Äô behavior was compared using the Mann Whitney test, while differences within each group across episodes were analyzed using the Wilcoxon paired sample test. The classification seemed to be effective at identifying both avoidant and secure attachment patterns in dogs. As expected, differences in key attachment behaviors, such as proximity/contact seeking toward the caregiver, between secure and avoidant dogs were more evident in the final episodes of the test. Differently from secure dogs, avoidant dogs did not show an increase in proximity/contact seeking behavior with the caregiver in any of the procedures. Further studies with larger samples are needed to support the effectiveness of this classification and investigate on the remaining attachment styles.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs,NA,NA

","There is ample evidence to suggest that dogs have highly developed, context-dependent social skills. Recent literature also indicates a human-like susceptibility to social influence in dogs. However, it is still unclear how the affective social context affects the way dogs behave in a situation involving an out-of-reach object. The experimental manipulation served to prime the dogs with positive and negative affect in the form of social interactions. Dogs (N = 20) participated in both a negative and a positive social interaction with an unfamiliar male experimenter. Having received pretreatment with different social stimuli, subjects were observed in an instrumental task with an unfamiliar female experimenter requesting an out-of-reach object. The analysis of the dogs‚Äô tendency to engage in the task revealed that although the type of pretreatment did not influence whether they retrieved the cued object or not, the social interactions had a facilitatory effect on other, more subtle aspects of their behaviour. The positive interaction resulted in longer duration of looking time at the experimenter; shorter latency of moving upon release and of approaching the experimenter. The priming effects of the negative social interaction manifested in longer duration of looking time at the owner after release while gazing more at the target object during the first trial. These behaviours, together with the finding that dogs were more hesitant to approach the experimenter after the negative social interaction, may indicate that a negative emotional stimulation (involving the owner‚Äôs and the experimenter‚Äôs unresponsive behaviour, separation and a threatening stranger) causes a temporary disruption in the dog-owner bond, motivating the dog to repair it afterwards. These findings suggest that the valence attributed to the social interaction during pretreatment has differential effects on dogs‚Äô subsequent behaviour. Possible parallels with and differences from human behaviour are discussed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs,NA,NA

","A visit to a veterinary clinic can be very stressful for the dog, and stress may interact with pain. The aim of this study was to observe the behavior of dogs in a veterinary clinic and to correlate it with subjective stress assessments by different persons. Systems have already been developed to assess pain in dogs. We tested the behavior of 105 dogs, sampled from 233 dog owners who completed our questionnaire and whose dogs were patients at the clinic. The dog owner, the test leader, the nurse, and the veterinarian were each asked to assess if the dog was experiencing pain or was stressed and to evaluate, overall, how the dog experienced the visit. Three behavior tests were also carried out to describe the dog's reaction in the veterinary clinic: a ‚Äúsocial contact‚Äù test, a ‚Äúplay‚Äù test, and a ‚Äútreat‚Äù test. The play and treat tests were carried out both inside and outside the veterinary clinic to see if the dogs reacted differently in the 2 situations. Agreement between observers was good to excellent but generally better when assessing pain than stress. Dogs rated as more stressed were significantly less likely to engage in social contact with an unfamiliar person (P < 0.0001). They were significantly more willing to play and eat a treat outside the veterinary clinic compared to inside the clinic (P < 0.001), implying that the dogs themselves experienced inside the clinic as being more negative. The results also indicated that the type of relationship the owner has with the dog may influence the dog's behavior during the clinical examination. The good agreements between the different measures in this study suggest that there is potential for a system to be developed to assess the extent to which the dog is stressed in the clinic.","p. 24-31 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,"Dogs;Hospitals, Animal",NA,NA

The present study aimed to further investigate whether oxytocin and cortisol levels in the previously tested owners and dogs were associated with their behaviors during the interaction experiment. Ten female volunteer dog-owners and their male Labrador dogs participated in a 60 min interaction experiment with interaction taking place during 0-3 min and blood samples for analysis of oxytocin and cortisol were collected at 0, 1, 3, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min. The entire experiment was videotaped and the following variables were noted; the different types (stroking, scratching, patting and activating touch, i.e., scratching and patting combined) as well as the frequency of touch applied by the owner, the number of times the owner touched her dog, the dog's positions and time spent in each position. Correlations were analyzed between the behavioral variables and basal oxytocin levels, maximum oxytocin levels, delta oxytocin levels, basal cortisol levels and cortisol levels at 15 min. Owners with low oxytocin levels before and during the interaction touched their dogs more frequently (0 min: Rs = -0.683, p = 0.042; oxytocin maximum: Rs = -0.783, p = 0.013). The lower the dogs' oxytocin levels during the interaction, the more stroking they received (Rs = -0.717, p = 0.041). The more frequently activating touch was applied by the owner, the higher the dogs' cortisol levels became (15 min: Rs = 0.661, p = 0.038). The higher the owners' maximum oxytocin level the fewer position changes the dogs made (Rs = -0.817, p = 0.007) and the shorter time they spent sitting (Rs = -0.786, p = 0.036), whereas the higher the owners' basal cortisol levels, the longer time the dogs spent standing (0 min: Rs = 0.683, p = 0.041). In conclusion, oxytocin and cortisol levels, both in dogs and in their owners, are associated with the way the owners interact with their dogs and also with behaviors caused by the interaction.","1796 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Hydrocortisone;Dogs;MSH Release-Inhibiting Hormone;Oxytocin,NA,NA

Most dogs (83.87%) showed at least one act characteristic of aggressive behaviour during the test. In 69.35% of the cases, the dog's posture was lower than neutral. The results of this study showed that the dogs reacted to this test with fear-related aggression, as dogs exhibiting aggressive biting behaviour express a lower posture than dogs exhibiting either threatening or non-aggressive biting behaviour (F sub(3) sub(4) sub(8) sub(8)=10.71, p<0.001).

Salivary cortisol was measured and questionnaires were used to assess owner and dog personality as well as owners' social attitudes towards the dog and towards other humans. We calculated the individual coefficient of variance of cortisol (iCV = sd/mean*100) over the different test situations as a parameter representing individual variability of cortisol concentration. We hypothesized that high cortisol variability indicates efficient and adaptive coping and a balanced individual and dyadic social performance. Female owners of male dogs had lower iCV than all other owner gender-dog sex combinations (F = 14.194, p<0.001), whereas owner Agreeableness (NEO-FFI) scaled positively with owner iCV (F = 4.981, p = 0.028).

This study aimed at further investigating whether OT enhances task performance by increasing choices made, or by increasing correctness of choices made, and to compare these treatment effects to dog appeasing pheromone (DAP), known to balance emotional activation in dogs. Hence, we compared OCT performance between three groups of dogs: (i) dogs administered OT and a sham collar, (ii) dogs administered a saline placebo and a DAP collar, and (iii) control dogs administered a saline placebo and a sham collar. All three groups consisted of a combination of male and female pet dogs and assistance-dogs-in-training currently living with a volunteer carer. The study also evaluated the effect of intranasal OT and/or DAP on plasma levels of OT, and prolactin; which has previously been linked with anxiety in dogs. The dogs' emotional state was measured using the Emotional Disorders Evaluation in Dogs (EDED) scale. The owners'/carers' degree of anxious- and avoidant-style attachment to their dogs was accessed using the Pet Attachment Questionnaire (PAQ). Interesting descriptive data appeared for both treatment groups. Particularly, in OT group, we obtained significant results demonstrating that intranasal OT enhances OCT performance in dogs compared to control, by increasing the percentage of correct choices, but not the number of choices, made. Results also support that the mode of action of intranasal OT is via direct access to the brain and not via the blood, since no elevation of plasma OT (or prolactin) levels were observed after intranasal administration in this study. Similarly, DAP application did not significantly alter OT or prolactin peripheral concentrations. Several differences were observed between fostered and pet dogs, namely: fostered dogs demonstrated higher levels of serum prolactin, made more choices on the OCT compared to pet dogs but were not more likely to be correct, and were fostered by carers with higher avoidant attachment scores than pet dog owners.

At the beginning of the study, all dogs' reactions were assessed by short test situations to divide them into 2 groups, that is, dogs with behavioral changes such as fear and aggression (group 1) and dogs without behavioral changes (group 2). Behavior and emotional assessments were done in the beginning and at the end of the program that lasted 6 weeks. It was observed that most dogs were obeying basic signals or requests on and off leash. In the second assessment, most of the dogs were displaying relaxed body posture while interacting with humans. Nevertheless, only significant difference was found between the groups in adaptability to home environment (Mann-Whitney U test, P < 0.05). None of the dogs in group 1 were evaluated as relaxed, whereas all the dogs in group 2 were displaying relaxed body posture, thus a positive emotional state, in home environment on the first day. Findings of this study showed that a standardized rehabilitation program including training and adaptation to home environment might be beneficial for some urban free‚Äìranging dogs to improve their behaviors and welfare in shelter environment. Moreover, it can be suggested that urban free‚Äìranging dogs can easily be trained and adapted to humans in case where they did not have intense fear and/or aggression.","p. 1-6 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs,NA,NA

Department of Psychology, Wright State University, Dayton, OH 45435, United States ","Some otherwise non-aggressive dogs may display fear-induced aggression under stressful conditions. Admittance to an animal shelter is a stressful experience for dogs, and aggression is often used as a criterion by shelters for precluding opportunities for adoption. We, therefore, examined whether a program of enrichment centered around a form of human interaction known to reduce the stress of shelter dogs would also reduce the aggression of fearful dogs and improve their general welfare. Fearful dogs displaying signs of aggression, as well as dogs displaying neither fear nor aggression, either did or did not receive 30‚Äâmin a day of human interaction in a secluded room for approximately the first 5 days in a shelter. We then determined the number of enriched and non-enriched fearful and non-fearful dogs that passed a standard test of dog aggression as typically implemented in this shelter to determine eligibility for adoption. We also examined the affective state of dogs in a test of cognitive bias. In two separate experiments, we found that most fearful dogs without enrichment failed the aggression test, whereas most fearful dogs undergoing enrichment completed this assessment successfully (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ 0.001 in each experiment). In contrast, nearly all non-fearful dogs passed the aggression test regardless of enrichment experience. In cognitive bias testing, enrichment reduced the latency at which fearful dogs approached two locations at which the likelihood of reinforcement was ambiguous, a measure of increased positive expectancy (P""s < 0.01). Unexpectedly non-fearful dogs receiving enrichment approached one of the ambiguous locations more slowly than non-enriched controls (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ 0.05), a finding that might be an artifact of the testing procedures used here. While the generality of the results needs to be tested in other populations and shelter environments, the findings: 1) document the vulnerability of dogs exhibiting fear-induced aggression in a shelter environment; 2) demonstrate the ability of an enrichment program focusing on human interaction to reduce aggressiveness in these dogs and thereby increase their chances of being offered for adoption; and, 3) indicate a more-general outcome of the enrichment procedure on the affective state of fearful dogs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Dogs;Aggression,NA,NA

","The aim of this study was to investigate if an owner's adult attachment style (AAS) influences how their dog interacts and obtains support from them during challenging events. A person's AAS describes how they perceive their relationship to other people, but it may also reflect their caregiving behavior, and so their behavior toward the dog. We measured the AAS of 51 female Golden retriever owners, using the Adult Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ), and observed the reactions of the dog-owner dyads in response to different challenging situations [visual surprise, auditory stressor and social stressors like a person approaching dressed as ghost or in coat, hat and sunglasses]. In addition, the dog was left alone in a novel environment for 3 min. Interactions between the dog and owner were observed both before and after separation. Spearman rank correlation tests were made (between owner AAS and dog behavior) and where correlations were found, Mann-Whitney U-tests were made on the dogs' behavioral response between high and low scoring groups of owners of the different subscales of the ASQ. The more secure the owner (ASQ subscale 'Confidence'), the longer the dog was oriented to the two sudden stressors (the visual and auditory stressor). The more anxious the owner (ASQ subscale 'Attachment anxiety'), the longer the dog oriented toward the owner during the approach of the strange-looking person and the dog showed less lip licking during separation from the owner. The more avoidant the owner (ASQ subscale 'Avoidant attachment'), the longer the dog oriented toward the owner during the visual stressor, the less it was located behind the owner during the auditory stressor and the less it was oriented toward the auditory stressor. These links between owner attachment style and dog behavior imply that dogs may develop different strategies to handle challenging situations, based on the type of support they get from their owner.","2059 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs,NA,NA

","The inclusion of life history as a possible influential factor is pivotal in studies on behavior, welfare, and cognition. Shelter dogs have usually experienced a life involving poor social interactions with humans. Thus, we aimed to investigate the behavioral responses of shelter dogs (SDs) and companion dogs (CDs) during the training of two vocal cues (""sit"", ""paw""), as well as the possible associations between their responses and the behaviors of trainers. We studied 15 SDs and 15 CDs in up to eight five-minute training sessions. Dogs' and trainers' behaviors were recorded and analyzed (through GLM, GLMM, correlation and Mann-Whitney tests). Shelter dogs responded to more cues per session, with shorter latencies and fewer repetitions of cues. Moreover, SDs spent more time wagging their tails. Dogs' sex and trainers' behaviors were also associated with differences in dogs' responses. The use of a reproachful tone of voice was associated with a greater number of cues responded to, shorter latencies, and fewer repetitions of cues. However, this type voice/discourse was also linked to a greater exhibition of non-training behaviors (e.g., exploring the room or jumping on the trainer), and to dogs spending less time next to the trainer and wagging their tails. On the other hand, the use of a neutral tone of voice and laughter, besides being linked to performance, was also associated with longer durations of tail wagging. Furthermore, the duration of the trainers' orientation to dogs was correlated with the orientation of the dogs to the trainers. Our data suggest that, even when having experienced social deprivation from humans, SDs' capacities to learn vocal cues were preserved, possibly due to ontogenic homeostasis processes. Shelter dogs' greater interest in the sessions may be also credited to their socially-deprived routine. Our outcomes also point to an association between friendly interactions during training and dog performance and excitement, which suggests that such interactions may have the potential to improve SD welfare.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Dogs;Cues,NA,NA

Two integral, but infrequently confirmed, assumptions of latent variable models in animal personality are: i) behavioural variables are independent (i.e., uncorrelated) conditional on the latent personality traits they reflect (local independence), and ii) personality traits are associated with behavioural variables in the same way across individuals or groups of individuals (measurement invariance). We tested these assumptions using observations of aggression in four age classes (4‚Äì10 months, 10 months‚Äì3 years, 3‚Äì6 years, over 6 years) of male and female shelter dogs (N = 4,743) in 11 different contexts. A structural equation model supported the hypothesis of two positively correlated personality traits underlying aggression across contexts: aggressiveness towards people and aggressiveness towards dogs (comparative fit index: 0.96; Tucker-Lewis index: 0.95; root mean square error of approximation: 0.03). Aggression across contexts was moderately repeatable (towards people: intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.479; towards dogs: ICC = 0.303). However, certain contexts related to aggressiveness towards people (but not dogs) shared significant residual relationships unaccounted for by latent levels of aggressiveness. Furthermore, aggressiveness towards people and dogs in different contexts interacted with sex and age. Thus, sex and age differences in displays of aggression were not simple functions of underlying aggressiveness. Our results illustrate that the robustness of traits in latent variable models must be critically assessed before making conclusions about the effects of, or factors influencing, animal personality. Our findings are of concern because inaccurate ‚Äúaggressive personality‚Äù trait attributions can be costly to dogs, recipients of aggression and society in general.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs;Aggression,NA,NA

Ninety purpose bred, 1- to 10-year-old laboratory beagles of both sexes from 4 research facilities were subjected to: a new, standardized behavioral test including unfamiliar situations, varied and novel manipulations not routinely involved in physical examination as performed by an unfamiliar person, and novel optical and acoustic stimuli. An earlier article reported on these dogs' responses to approaches and physical examination by known and unknown people (DoÃàring et al., 2014). Here, we concentrate on the effects of environmental stimuli and atypical manipulations. Videotape-based assessment and scoring of the dogs' behavior showed distinct patterns of reactions. Most dogs reacted with interest toward the unfamiliar test person and readily established contact. Many dogs reacted with uncertainty to the unfamiliar object and sound. Signals that may indicate conflict or distress (muzzle licking, paw lifting, and panting) were observed in some of the dogs in all facilities and in all parts of the test. Lowest body language scores indicated by anxious and/or ‚Äúsubmissive‚Äù postures were observed when the dogs' muzzles were held shut or when the dogs were covered with a thin cloth.Characteristic housing conditions of the different facilities significantly affected several endpoints. Male dogs were significantly less fearful than females in several parameters and older and facility-bred dogs were significantly less fearful.

Furthermore, these studies show mixed results. The goal of this study was to provide an in-depth picture of the effects of these interactions on the dogs involved by considering multiple physiological measures known to be associated with emotional state (continuous heart rate, heart rate variability, pre- and post-session tympanic membrane temperatures, and salivary cortisol and oxytocin concentrations). Nineteen Mayo Clinic Caring Canine therapy dogs completed five 20-minute animal-assisted activity (AAA) visits each in an outpatient clinical setting (Mayo Clinic Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Clinic). From a physiological perspective, the dogs showed a neutral to positive response to the AAA sessions. Heart rate (HR) was significantly lower at the end of the session compared with the beginning of the session (F = 17.26, df1 = 1, df2 = 29.7, p = 0.0003). The right tympanic membrane temperature was lower post-session (F = 8.87, df1 = 1, df2 = 107, p = 0.003). All other emotional indicators remained stable between pre- and post-session. These results suggest that the dogs involved were not negatively affected by their participation in the AAA. Moreover, there was some evidence suggesting the dogs may have been in a more relaxed state at the end of the session (lower HR and lower right tympanic membrane temperature) compared to the beginning of the session.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Animal Shells;Dogs;Animals,NA,NA

Recent studies have revealed correlations between changes in morphology and behaviour as reported by owners. For example, as height and weight decrease, many undesirable behaviours (non-social fear, hyperactivity and attention seeking) become more apparent. The current study aimed to explore more of these correlations, but this time used reports from trained observers. Phenotypic measurements were recorded from a range of common dog breeds (n = 45) and included cephalic index (CI: the ratio of skull width to skull length), bodyweight, height and sex. These data were then correlated with results from the Dog Mentality Assessment (DMA), which involves trained observers scoring a dog‚Äôs reaction to stimuli presented over 10 standardised subtests. Each subtest is designed to evoke a behavioural response. Backward elimination and weighted step-wise regression revealed that shorter dogs demonstrated more aggressive tendencies, reacting defensively toward both assistants dressed as ghosts (p = 0.045), and to a dummy (p = 0.008). Taller dogs were more affectionate when greeting and being handled by humans (p = 0.007, p = <0.001, respectively). Taller dogs were also more cooperative (p = <0.001), and playful (p = 0.001) with humans than shorter dogs.

Lighter dogs were also cautious of, and demonstrated prolonged fearfulness toward, the source of metallic noise (p = <0.001, p = <0.034, respectively). With a far larger sample and the advantage of third-party reporting (which overcomes potential owner bias), the current findings build on previous studies in this field, further supporting covariance between morphology and behaviour.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs,NA,NA

Although aversive-based training has been strongly criticized for negatively affecting dog welfare, there is no comprehensive research focusing on companion dogs and mainstream techniques, and most studies rely on owner-reported assessment of training methods and dog behavior. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of aversive- and reward-based training methods on companion dog welfare within and outside the training context. Ninety-two companion dogs were recruited from three reward-based schools (Group Reward, n = 42), and from four aversive-based schools, two using low proportions of aversive-based methods (Group Mixed, n = 22) and two using high proportions of aversive-based methods (Group Aversive, n = 28). For evaluating welfare during training, dogs were video recorded for three sessions and six saliva samples were collected, three at home (baseline levels) and three after training (post-training levels). Video recordings were used to examine the frequency of stress-related behaviors (e.g., lip lick, yawn) and the overall behavioral state of the dog (e.g., tense, relaxed), and saliva samples were analyzed for cortisol concentration. For evaluating welfare outside the training context, dogs participated in a cognitive bias task. Results showed that dogs from Group Aversive displayed more stress-related behaviors, were more frequently in tense and low behavioral states and panted more during training, and exhibited higher post-training increases in cortisol levels than dogs from Group Reward. Additionally, dogs from Group Aversive were more ‚Äòpessimistic‚Äô in the cognitive bias task than dogs from Group Reward. Dogs from Group Mixed displayed more stress-related behaviors, were more frequently in tense states and panted more during training than dogs from Group Reward. Finally, although Groups Mixed and Aversive did not differ in their performance in the cognitive bias task nor in cortisol levels, the former displayed more stress-related behaviors and was more frequently in tense and low behavioral states. These findings indicate that aversive-based training methods, especially if used in high proportions, compromise the welfare of companion dogs both within and outside the training context.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs,NA,NA

EHIP increased the time the dogs were visible from the front of the pen and the time they were tail wagging (p <0.05). These changes may make the animals more likely to be re-homed. No behavioural sign of stress was recorded when the program was discontinued. These findings lead to conclude that EHIPs may be useful enrichment programs for shelter dogs. Furthermore, the NPC Test proved to be a suitable and powerful statistical tool since it does not need a modelling for dependence among variables and it is not affected by the problem of loss of degrees of freedom when the number of variables is large compared to sample size as was the case in the present study.","p. 211-219 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Dogs,NA,NA

","Ample evidence suggests that dogs possess enhanced skills in reading human visual attention, but it remains to be explored whether they are sensitive to the audience effect in their interactions with humans. The present study aimed to investigate how dogs' behavior is affected by their owners' visual attention while performing a repetitive task (bringing an object back to an unfamiliar experimenter while the owner waited passively). We assumed that if dogs are susceptible to the audience effect, their task persistence and task performance would vary according to their owners' attentiveness. A group of adult pet dogs (N = 27) were repeatedly presented with an object retrieval task by the experimenter (N = 20 trials) while owners either ignored their dogs (Inattentive Owner condition) or paid attention to their dogs' actions (Attentive Owner condition). Behavioral observations were complemented with the owner's reports of their relationships with their dogs (assessed by means of an owner-pet attachment questionnaire) and dogs' spectral EEG sleep profile (recorded during 3-h-long daytime sleep). Although dogs, independently of their owners' attentional state, were generally willing to comply with the fetching task, they were faster to approach the toy object and gazed significantly longer at their owners when he/she was paying attention. This finding is reminiscent of peer influence observed in humans. Further, characteristics of relationship insecurity (relationship anxiety and avoidance) were associated with dogs' task persistence and performance. Dogs of owners with higher relationship anxiety tended to approach the toy object less frequently, and dogs of owners with higher relationship avoidance and anxiety were more hesitant to approach the toy object. We also found that dogs' individual susceptibilities to the audience effect is related to EEG spectral power of both REM and non-REM sleep as well as in pre-sleep (drowsiness) in a trait-like manner. These results, in line with previous findings, support the notion that dogs have a somewhat human-like susceptibility to the audience effect, a trait which might be linked to more complex mechanisms, such as self-presentation or reputation management, helping the two species to become effective social partners.","1461 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs,NA,NA

Each session consisted of 5 minutes of training with a treat reward followed by 3 minutes of rest and finally an operant conditioning test that consisted of 20 ""hand motion"" cues. The operant tests were conducted a total of nine times over three consecutive days, and the success numbers were counted. The duration of the dog's behavior, focusing on the dog's eyes, mouth, ears, tail and tail-wagging, was recorded during the operant conditioning sessions before the test. Particular behaviors, including wide-eyes, closed mouth, erect ears, and forward and high tail carriage, without wagging or with short and quick wagging, related to high achievement results.

In this study, we examined attachment relationships between dogs living in animal shelters and foster homes and their temporary caregivers-shelter volunteers or foster volunteers, respectively. We also examined these results in relation to previously published data from pet dogs in order to contextualize our findings. Our findings indicate that the percentage of securely attached shelter dogs was significantly lower than that previously observed in scientific studies of the pet dog population. No differences were found between proportions of securely attached foster dogs and prior research with pets. We did not find significant differences between foster and shelter dogs in terms of attachment style proportions. We also found evidence of disinhibited attachment, which is associated with a lack of appropriate social responses with unfamiliar and familiar individuals in foster and shelter dogs. This is the first study to apply attachment theory to foster and shelter settings.AbstractThis study aimed to characterize attachment relationships between humans and dogs living in animal shelters or foster homes, and to contextualize these relationships in the broader canine attachment literature. In this study, 21 pairs of foster dogs and foster volunteers and 31 pairs of shelter dogs and shelter volunteers participated. Each volunteer‚Äìdog dyad participated in a secure base test and a paired attachment test. All volunteers completed the Lexington Attachment to Pets Scale (LAPS), a survey designed to measure strength of attachment bonds as reported by humans. Although no significant differences were present in terms of proportions of insecure and secure attachments between foster and shelter populations, proportions in the shelter population were significantly lower (p< 0.05) than the proportions of attachment styles that would be expected in a population of pet dogs based on the published literature on pet dog attachment styles. Additionally, findings are presented in relation to data from a paired attachment test that demonstrate foster and shelter dogs spend more time in proximity to humans when the human is actively attending to the dog and encouraging interaction, as would be expected based on previous studies. We also present findings related to the presence of disinhibited attachment (previously reported in children who spent a significant portion of time living in institutionalized settings) which is characterized by a lack of preferential proximity seeking with a familiar caregiver and excessive friendliness towards strangers in foster and shelter dogs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Dogs,NA,NA

","It has been suggested that dogs' remarkable capacity to use human communicative signals lies in their comparable social cognitive skills; however, this view has been questioned recently. The present study investigated associations between oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) polymorphisms and social behavior in human infants and dogs with the aim to unravel potentially differential mechanisms behind their responsiveness to human gaze. Sixteen-month-old human infants (N = 99) and adult Border Collie dogs (N = 71) participated in two tasks designed to test (1) their use of gaze-direction as a cue to locate a hidden object, and (2) their reactions to an aversive social interaction (using the still face task for children and a threatening approach task for dogs). Moreover, we obtained DNA samples to analyze associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the OXTR (dogs: -213AG, -94TC, -74CG, rs8679682, children: rs53576, rs1042778, rs2254298) and behavior. We found that OXTR genotype was significantly associated with reactions to an aversive social interaction both in dogs and children, confirming the anxiolytic effect of oxytocin in both species. In dogs, the genotypes linked to less fearful behavior were associated also with a higher willingness to follow gaze whereas in children, OXTR gene polymorphisms did not affect gaze following success. This pattern of gene-behavior associations suggests that for dogs the two situations are more alike (potentially fear-inducing or competitive) than for human children. This raises the possibility that, in contrast to former studies proposing human-like cooperativeness in dogs, dogs may perceive human gaze in an object-choice task in a more antagonistic manner than children.","2156 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Dogs;Infant;Interpersonal Relations,NA,NA

This study compared the behaviour of single-housed shelter dogs and cats while being read a book (using a prerecording) in the presence of an unfamiliar human (without direct physical contact) or in its absence. Behaviours such as scratching the door, gaze direction and location in relation to the audio source/human were observed for 10 min. When a human was present, dogs spent longer in their bed and looking at the auditory source, while cats scratched the door and rubbed against the door. In the absence of the human, cats tended to spend more time in the vertical dimension, where the hiding boxes were located. Overall, the presence of a person, combined with auditory enrichment, induced greater interest compared to just an audio stimulation in both shelter dogs and cats. However, some animals showed signs of frustration likely due to not being able to physically interact with the human. Given that dogs that exhibit calmness and cats that scratch the door in the presence of humans and try to attract human attention are more likely to be adopted, auditory enrichment combined with human presence promotes behaviours that may consequentially increase adoption rate.AbstractReading books to shelter animals combining auditory enrichment with human presence is increasingly used although its effects on animal welfare have not yet been investigated. This study compared the behaviour of single-housed shelter dogs and cats during a prerecorded reading condition in the absence or presence of an unfamiliar human (without direct physical contact). Fourteen dogs and twenty-one cats were observed in their enclosure in the two conditions in a counterbalanced order. Behaviours such as scratching the door, gaze direction and location in relation to the audio source/human were analysed from video recording for 10 min per condition. Dogs spent more time in their bed (p< 0.047) and looking at the auditory source (p< 0.004) when a human was present. Cats showed door scratching and rubbing when a human was present (p< 0.043), whereas they tended to spend more time in the vertical dimension (p = 0.051), where the hiding boxes were located, during auditory stimulation without a human present. These results show that the presence of a human induces greater interest compared to just audio stimulation in shelter dogs and cats but may induce frustration likely due to not being able to physically interact in some animals.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Dogs;Cats,NA,NA

The present paper investigates heart rate‚Äîone of the most commonly used emotion-related physiology measures‚Äîin the family dog, with the aim of uncovering its potential relationship with emotions. Sleep recordings were conducted following a positive versus a negative social interaction, as sleep alternations are one of the most conspicuous changes in response to negative affect. We observed differences in heart rate following the positive versus negative interactions, however these were only apparent during wakefulness, but not during sleep.AbstractThe domestic dog (Canis familiaris) has been shown to both excel in recognising human emotions and produce emotion-related vocalisations and postures that humans can easily recognise. However, little is known about the effect of emotional experiences on subsequent sleep physiology, a set of phenomena heavily interrelated with emotions in the case of humans. The present paper examines heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) during dogs‚Äô sleep, measures that are influenced by both positive and negative emotions in awake dogs. In Study I, descriptive HR and HRV data is provided on N = 12 dogs about the different sleep stages (wake, drowsiness, non-rapid eye movement (non-REM), REM; scoring based on electroencephalogram (EEG) data). We conclude that wakefulness is characterised by higher HR and lower HRV compared to all sleep stages. Furthermore, drowsiness is characterised by higher HR and lower HRV than non-REM and REM, but only if the electrocardiogram (ECG) samples are taken from the first occurrence of a given sleep stage, not when the longest periods of each sleep stage are analysed. Non-REM and REM sleep were not found to be different from each other in either HR or HRV parameters. In Study II, sleep HR and HRV measures are compared in N = 16 dogs after a positive versus negative social interaction (within-subject design). The positive social interaction consisted of petting and ball play, while the negative social interaction was a mixture of separation, threatening approach and still face test. Results are consistent with the two-dimensional emotion hypothesis in that following the intense positive interaction more elevated HR and decreased HRV is found compared to the mildly negative (lower intensity) interaction. However, although this trend can be observed in all sleep stages except for REM, the results only reach significance in the wake stage. In sum, the present findings suggest that HR and HRV are possible to measure during dogs‚Äô sleep, and can potentially be used to study the effect of emotions not only during but also after such interactions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Heart Rate;Dogs;Emotions,NA,NA

","Working dogs trained to be detection/sniffer dogs must work closely with their human partners. Pet dogs are also often asked to perform tasks, whether in a casual context (e.g., going for a walk) or as part of more formal activity (e.g., competitive sport). For the best performance outcomes, each partner must signal well to the other, and accurately read and respond to the other's signals. As part of a larger study comparing problem-solving behavior and information use in working dogs and pet dogs, we compared the detailed responses of 40 detection dogs and 80 pet dogs to verbal signals under two conditions: when the handler was facing the dog (front-facing condition) versus when the handler had his back to the dog, while giving a verbal request (back-facing condition). We hypothesize that: (1) both groups of dogs would be more accurate and faster in response when they could see the humans' faces and anterior bodies (front-facing condition) than in the back-facing condition; (2) dogs who did not respond immediately and correctly to the signal would exhibit behavioral signs of anxiety, uncertainty, and possibly distress, and such signals would be more common in the back-facing condition; and (3) the working dogs would be more consistent and successful as a group when compared to the pet dogs because working dogs have been specifically trained to do a job, in joint collaboration with humans who signal to them when and where to do the job and when they are successful. As such, clear signaling and response was already part of their practiced and tested daily life, and so should be reflected in their testing in this study. All testing was video recorded using the same test design and same order of tests. Neither pet nor working dogs were familiar with the test before initial testing, and neither was tested in a physical space that was familiar to them. Video analysis determined latency to response, time to completion of requested task, and identification of behaviors exhibited during the two conditions (human facing the dog/front-facing condition, or with the human's back turned to the dog/back-facing condition). Requests were given verbally using a normal tone of voice. Handlers were asked not to use hand signals. The three requests used were ‚Äúsit,‚Äù ‚Äúdown,‚Äù and ‚Äústay‚Äù. For most comparisons, dogs were slower to respond and took longer to complete each request when they were unable to see the handler's face (back-facing condition) (all P < 0.05). The behaviors exhibited when the working dogs could not see their handler's face were largely associated with seeking further information that would allow the dog to comply with the request. This pattern of response suggests that improvements in signaling behavior and understanding for both team members can and should be made and should lead to improvements in the dogs' welfare and better team performance. Pet dogs exhibited both information-seeking behaviors and those associated with anxiety when they could not see their owner's face, suggesting that working on efficient and accurate exchange of cues and responses would improve pet dog welfare and help to create a trusting relationship where anxiety about collaborative tasks is minimized.","p. 55-66 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs,NA,NA

Each session was videotaped, and specific behaviors during 5-min petting interactions were coded. Salivary cortisol levels were significantly higher in the novel setting (0.397Œºg/dL) compared to activity (0.257Œºg/dL) and home (0.213Œºg/dL) settings at time 30min (P=0.01 and P=0.03, respectively).

","Simple SummaryAnimal shelters can be stressful places for dogs to live. Social isolation is likely one component of the environment that contributes to poor welfare but spending time out of the kennel with a person has been shown to temporarily ameliorate that stress. In this study, 164 shelter-living dogs at four animal shelters across the United States were taken on two-and-half-hour outings with a person and physiological measures of stress and physical activity captured by accelerometer devices were compared before, during, and after this short-term outing. We found that dogs‚Äô stress was higher when they were away on these field trips and their activity changed, including less time spent in low activity and more time in higher activity. While measures of physiology and activity were found to return to pre-field trip levels the following day, these results suggest that outings of this duration do not provide the same reduction in stress as previously shown with temporary fostering. Nevertheless, short-term outings may provide shelter dogs with greater adoption visibility and assist in foster recruitment and, thus, should be further explored.AbstractSocial isolation likely contributes to reduced welfare for shelter-living dogs. Several studies have established that time out of the kennel with a person can improve dogs‚Äô behavior and reduce physiological measures of stress. This study assessed the effects of two-and-a-half-hour outings on the urinary cortisol levels and activity of dogs as they awaited adoption at four animal shelters. Dogs‚Äô urine was collected before and after outings for cortisol:creatinine analysis, and accelerometer devices were used to measure dogs‚Äô physical activity. In total, 164 dogs participated in this study, with 793 cortisol values and 3750 activity measures used in the statistical analyses. We found that dogs‚Äô cortisol:creatinine ratios were significantly higher during the afternoon of the intervention but returned to pre-field trip levels the following day. Dogs‚Äô minutes of low activity were significantly reduced, and high activity significantly increased during the outing. Although dogs‚Äô cortisol and activity returned to baseline after the intervention, our findings suggest that short-term outings do not confer the same stress reduction benefits as previously shown with temporary fostering. Nevertheless, it is possible that these types of outing programs are beneficial to adoptions by increasing the visibility of dogs and should be further investigated to elucidate these effects.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs,NA,NA

Japan Society for the Promotion of Sciences, Tokyo, Japan","In humans, the susceptibility to yawn contagion has been theoretically and empirically related to our capacity for empathy. Because of its relevance to evolutionary biology, this phenomenon has been the focus of recent investigations in non-human species. In line with the empathic hypothesis, contagious yawning has been shown to correlate with the level of social attachment in several primate species. Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) have also shown the ability to yawn contagiously. To date, however, the social modulation of dog contagious yawning has received contradictory support and alternative explanations (i.e., yawn as a mild distress response) could explain positive evidence. The present study aims to replicate contagious yawning in dogs and to discriminate between the two possible mediating mechanisms (i.e., empathic vs. distress related response). Twenty-five dogs observed familiar (dog‚Äôs owner) and unfamiliar human models (experimenter) acting out a yawn or control mouth movements. Concurrent physiological measures (heart rate) were additionally monitored for twenty-one of the subjects. The occurrence of yawn contagion was significantly higher during the yawning condition than during the control mouth movements. Furthermore, the dogs yawned more frequently when watching the familiar model than the unfamiliar one demonstrating that the contagiousness of yawning in dogs correlated with the level of emotional proximity. Moreover, subjects‚Äô heart rate did not differ among conditions suggesting that the phenomenon of contagious yawning in dogs is unrelated to stressful events. Our findings are consistent with the view that contagious yawning is modulated by affective components of the behavior and may indicate that rudimentary forms of empathy could be present in domesticated dogs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Bias (Epidemiology);Dogs,NA,NA

In the present study, we analyzed the salivary fluctuations of these neuropeptides in both behaviorally normal dogs and dogs with separation distress in response to a three-minute separation from the owner, in a new environment. Dogs with a previous diagnosis of separation distress showed more anxiety-related behaviors and higher concentrations of vasopressin than control dogs when separated from the owner. Further research is needed on the potential use of salivary vasopressin as an early, non-invasive biomarker of anxiety-related disorders in pet dogs.AbstractPhysiological biomarkers of canine anxiety have not been extensively investigated to date. To identify new biomarkers in dogs, we compared behaviorally normal dogs (Control group, N = 13) to dogs diagnosed with separation problems (Case group, N = 13) as they were introduced into a novel environment in the presence of two strangers and subjected to a short episode of separation and reunion with the owner. During the separation phase, dogs in the Case group explored significantly less than controls and were significantly more persistent in expressing passive stress-coping strategies aimed at seeking proximity to their owners. When the owners returned, dogs with separation distress spent significantly more time jumping up on the strangers than control dogs did. Salivary oxytocin and vasopressin concentrations did not differ between samples taken before and after the separation. However, vasopressin concentrations immediately after separation were significantly higher in the Case than in the Control group and remained higher, although not significantly so, 10 min later. These results indicated that dogs with separation distress became more anxious than typical dogs when separated from their owner in an unfamiliar environment and provided preliminary support for the use of salivary vasopressin as a possible biomarker for anxiety-related responses in dogs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Biological Markers;Dogs;Vasopressins;Anxiety,NA,NA

In addition to the decrease in the rate of the instrumental response, it produces an aversive emotional state known as frustration. This state can be assimilated with the fear reactions that occur after aversive stimuli are introduced at both the physiological and behavioral levels. This study evaluated frustration reactions of domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) during a communicative situation involving interactions with a human. The task included the reinforcement and extinction of the gaze response toward the experimenter's face when the dogs tried to obtain inaccessible food. The dog's frustration reactions during extinction involved an increase in withdrawal and side orientation to the location of the human as well as lying down, ambulation, sniffing, and vocalizations compared with the last acquisition trial. These results are especially relevant for domestic dog training situations in which the extinction technique is commonly used to discourage undesirable behaviors.

The pups were studied in two object-preference tests at age 3, 4, and 5 weeks. After a short isolation, we observed the subjects' behavior in the presence of a pair of objects, one was always the subject's human foster parent (caregiver) and the other was varied; nursing bottle (3 weeks), unfamiliar adult dog (3 and 5 weeks), unfamiliar experimenter (4 and 5 weeks), and familiar conspecific age mate (4 weeks). Dogs and wolves did not differ in their general activity level during the tests. Wolf pups showed preference for the proximity of the caregiver in two of the tests; Bottle-Caregiver at the age of 3 weeks and Experimenter-Caregiver at the age of 5 weeks, while dogs showed preference to the caregiver in three tests; conspecific Pup-Caregiver and Experimenter-Caregiver at the age of 4 weeks and dog-caregiver at the age of 5. Compared to wolves, dogs tended to display more communicative signals that could potentially facilitate social interactions, such as distress vocalization, tail wagging, and gazing at the humans' face. In contrast to dog puppies, wolf pups showed aggressive behavior toward a familiar experimenter and also seemed to be more prone to avoidance. Our results demonstrate that already at this early age--despite unprecedented intensity of socialization and the comparable social (human) environment during early development--there are specific behavioral differences between wolves and dogs mostly with regard to their interactions with humans.","111-122 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Dogs;Species Specificity,NA,NA

However, it is important to ensure the enrichment provides benefit to the animal, and as such the behaviour of the animals can be monitored to understand the activities‚Äô impacts. A pilot study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of seven different EE activities on the behaviour of 10 training dogs housed in an office environment during training within an assistance dog charity. Results suggest there is a need to diversify thinking around EE, shifting common thinking of EE as one entity to instead consider EE in different categories and to ensure animals receive a mixture of EE types.AbstractEnvironmental enrichment (EE) can be used to enhance the environment of various animals. The aim of this pilot study was to determine the effects of seven EE activities (Bonding, Bubble machine, Conspecific play, Interactive toy, Playhouse, Stuffed food toy and Tug play) on dog behaviour, pre- and post-EE for dogs housed in an office environment during training as part of an assistance dog training programme. EE activities resulted in a significant increase in the frequency of relaxation behaviours (p< 0.01) and a significant reduction in alert (p< 0.01) and stress behaviours (p = 0.02). Results suggest various benefits of the different activities with Conspecific Play and Playhouse activities having the greatest overall positive behaviour change when compared to the other activities. The food-based EE activities (Interactive toy and Stuffed food toy) had the least behaviour change of all the activities provided. Findings will be of interest to pet owners, animal rescue centres, dog trainers and working dog organisations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs;Pilot Projects,NA,NA

While oxytocin has been shown to influence human-directed affiliative behaviors in dogs, no study investigated yet how such factors moderate these effects. Our study aimed to investigate whether the context and the dogs' individual characteristics moderate the associations between the social affiliative (greeting) behavior and four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene. We recorded the greeting behavior in three contexts: (1) when the dog first met an unfamiliar experimenter, (2) during a separation from the owner, and (3) after the experimenter approached the dog in a threatening manner. In the latter two contexts (during separation and after threatening), we categorized the dogs into stressed and non-stressed groups based on their behavior in the preceding situations. In line with previous studies, we found that polymorphisms in the OXTR gene are related to the greeting behavior of dogs. However, we also showed that the analyzed SNPs were associated with greeting in different contexts and in different individuals, suggesting that the four SNPs might be related to different functions of the oxytocin system. The -213A/G was associated with greeting only when the dog had no prior negative experience with the experimenter. The rs8679682 was found in association with greeting in all three contexts but these associations were significant only in non-stressed dogs. The -94T/C was associated with greeting only when the dog was stressed and had an interaction with the sex of the dog. The -74C/G SNP was associated with greeting only when the dog was stressed during separation and also had a sex interaction. Taken together, our results suggest that, similarly to humans, the effects of oxytocin on the dogs' social behavior are not universal, but constrained by features of situations and individuals. Understanding these constraints helps further clarify how oxytocin mediates social behavior which, in the long run, could improve the application of oxytocin in pharmacotherapy.","2232 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Social Behavior,NA,NA

A major source of stress, especially for wild animals, is the lack of control over their environment, which includes not being able to avoid contact with human beings. Paradoxically, some studies have shown that interactions with human beings may improve the welfare of wild animals in captivity. Here, we investigated the behavioural (behaviours indicative of cooperation or stress) and physiological (variations in salivary cortisol concentrations) effects of the increasingly used practice of training wild animals as a way to facilitate handling and/or as behavioural enrichment. We evaluated the effects of indoor training sessions with familiar caretakers on nine human-socialised individuals of a wild species, the wolf (Canis lupus), in comparison to nine individuals of its domesticated form, the dog (Canis lupus familiaris). All animals were raised and kept in intraspecific packs under identical conditions-in accordance with the social structure of the species-in order to control for socialisation with human beings and familiarity with training. We also collected saliva samples of trainers to measure GC and testosterone concentrations, to control for the effects of trainers' stress levels on the responses of the animals. During the training sessions, separated from pack members, the animals stayed voluntarily close to the trainers and mostly adequately performed requested behaviours, indicating concentration to the task. Similarly to dogs, the salivary cortisol level of wolves-used as an index of stress-dropped during these sessions, pointing to a similar stress-reducing effect of the training interaction in both subspecies. The responses to the requested behaviours and the reduction in salivary cortisol level of wolves and dogs varied across trainers, which indicates that the relaxing effect of training has a social component. This points to another factor affecting the welfare of animals during the sessions, beside the rewarding effect of getting food and control over the situation by successfully completing a task. As all responses performed by the animals corresponded to cues already familiar to them, the reported effects were likely due to the above cited factors rather than to a learning process. Our results support previous findings suggesting that training is a potentially powerful tool for improving welfare in some wild social canids by creating structured and positive interactions between these animals and their human caretakers.","[dagger] | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Dogs,NA,NA

The aim of this study was to investigate whether green odour has a calming effect also on the domestic dog. Sixteen companion dogs participated in the study with their owners. Each dog was tested through a simplified version of the Ainsworth Strange Situation Test. Dogs acted as their own control, being tested three weeks apart in an experimental room once with the green odour and once without it. Saliva samples were collected, for both conditions, before the test and 20 min after separation in order to measure cortisol levels.The presence of green odour in the experimental room did not affect dog behaviour during separation from the owner. In addition, deltas of salivary cortisol levels in the two tests did not differ. However, differences in dog behaviour were observed when the owner was present, both before and after separation, indicating that, when tested in the presence of green odour, dogs sat more and spent less time in proximity to the owner. When tested without the green odour, dogs instead sought more contact with the owner. These findings suggest that green odour has a light stress-alleviating effect, which appears in more relaxed behaviour in the presence of the owner.","p. 73-78 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Pilot Projects;Dogs,NA,NA

Dogs received two 15 minute training sessions per day for 4‚Äì5 days. Training sessions were recorded on video for behavioural analysis. Saliva and urine were collected to assay for cortisol over the training period. During preliminary studies there were negative changes in dogs' behaviour on application of electric stimuli, and elevated cortisol post-stimulation. These dogs had generally experienced high intensity stimuli without pre-warning cues during training. In contrast, in the subsequent larger, controlled study, trainers used lower settings with a pre-warning function and behavioural responses were less marked. Nevertheless, Group A dogs spent significantly more time tense, yawned more often and engaged in less environmental interaction than Group C dogs. There was no difference in urinary corticosteroids between Groups. Salivary cortisol in Group A dogs was not significantly different from that in Group B or Group C, though Group C dogs showed higher measures than Group B throughout sampling. Following training 92% of owners reported improvements in their dog's referred behaviour, and there was no significant difference in reported efficacy across Groups. Owners of dogs trained using e-collars were less confident of applying the training approach demonstrated. These findings suggest that there is no consistent benefit to be gained from e-collar training but greater welfare concerns compared with positive reward based training.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs;Reward,NA,NA

The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic-adreno-medullar (SAM) axis are two main physiological pathways that constitute the stress response of an organism. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a mediator of the HPA axis and is known to be related to social behaviours and stress. The serum concentration of AVP is higher in more aggressive dogs and humans with post-traumatic stress disorder. Salivary biomarker analysis is a non-invasive method to assess stress. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possibility of using salivary AVP as an acute stress biomarker in dogs. Salivary AVP concentration was measured before and after exposure to all relevant environmental stimuli (i.e. car trip to the lab, physical examination by the veterinarian, and sampling procedure,) and then after 30‚Äâmin of vacuum noise exposure. Behavioural assessments, physiologic parameter assessments, and serum cortisol analysis were conducted in combination. Statistical analysis was conducted separately in the total study population, the less stressed group, and the more stressed group, respectively.Results Based on stress behaviour analysis scores, 28 dogs were classified into less or more stressed groups. All four physiologic parameters (blood pressure, body temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate) were significantly increased after noise and environmental challenges, in the more stressed group. Serum cortisol did not show any significant change. Salivary AVP significantly decreased after noise and environmental stimulation in the more stressed group but not in the less stressed group. Salivary AVP and blood pressure changes were negatively correlated in the more stressed group.Conclusion Salivary AVP may be a potential acute stress biomarker in dogs.","1-9 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs;Vasopressins;Biological Markers,NA,NA

Here we describe the first study to simultaneously collect objective DAD behavioural data from CCTV footage and concurrent owner glucose levels via a Flash Glucose Monitoring System (FGMS). Using a pre-defined behavioural ethogram, both trained and non-trained canine behaviours were recorded. Given that dogs are trained to display attention-seeking behaviours when their owners experience fluctuations outside of normal blood glucose levels, we would expect differences in DAD behaviour during periods when owner glucose levels transition from euglycaemia to hyperglycaemic (high) or hypoglycaemic (low) levels, as compared to periods when owners stay within target-range.A FreeStyle Libre FGMS was given to nine owners of accredited DADs from a single training establishment. Behavioural data were collected using CCTV in the participants' home, or place of work, for between five and 14 days (mean‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ12.2 days). For each person, between 19 and 29 (mean‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ22.5) one-hour periods were selected that captured approximately equal instances of owner glucose levels transitioning from in-range to hypoglycaemia, in-range to hyperglycaemia, or remaining within target-range. Two researchers coded footage without knowledge of the owner's glucose levels. Variables recorded included the DAD's Activity, Attentional State, Proximity to Owner, Attention-seeking, and potential Stress-related behaviours.There were significant differences between individual dogs' behaviour during in-range periods. When samples captured a transition to out-of-range glucose levels (hypo- or hyperglycaemia), the distribution of several behaviours among dogs in the cohort differed significantly from their distributions during in-range samples (p‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.01 for Conover Tests in Playing with Owner, Jump Up, Sniff Owner, Bark, Paw Owner, and Lick Owner), but consistent increases or decreases in the rate of any behaviours were not detected across the cohort. In individual dogs, we found distinctive behaviour changes during periods when their owner's glucose transitioned to out-of-range, as compared to when they remained in-range. Each DAD showed significant changes in the variance of at least one trained attention-seeking behaviour, with several dogs also showing changes in non-trained behaviours such as Change of State, Playing with Owner and potential stress-related behaviours (Yawning and Lip-Licking).

In line with this, polymorphisms of genes involved in oxytocin signaling, like the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene, are known to influence social behavior in various species. However, to date, no study has investigated environmental factors possibly influencing the epigenetic variation of the OXTR gene and its behavioral effects in dogs. Pet dogs form individualized and strong relationships with their owners who are central figures in the social environment of their dogs and therefore might influence the methylation levels of their OXTR gene. Here we set out to investigate whether DNA methylation within the OXTR promoter region of pet dogs is linked to their owner's interaction style and to the social behavior of the dogs. To be able to do so, we collected buccal epithelial cells and, in Study 1, we used pyrosequencing techniques to look for differentially methylated CpG sites in the canine OXTR promoter region on a heterogeneous sample of dogs and wolves of different ages and keeping conditions. Four identified sites (at positions -727, -751, -1371, and -1383 from transcription start site) showing more than 10% methylation variation were then, in Study 2, measured in triplicate in 217 pet Border Collies previously tested for reactions to an adverse social situation (i.e., approach by a threatening human) and with available data on their owners' interaction styles. We found that CpG methylation was significantly associated with the behavior of the dogs, in particular with the likelihood that dogs would hide behind their owner or remain passive when approached by a threatening human. On the other hand, CpG methylation was not related to the owners' behavior but to dog sex (at position -1371). Our findings underpin the complex relationship between epigenetics and behavior and highlight the importance of including epigenetic methods in the analysis of dog behavioral development. Further research is needed to investigate which environmental factors influence the epigenetic variation of the OXTR gene.","549 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Social Behavior;Dogs;Methylation,NA,NA

Likewise, the functional role of the ""social hormone"" oxytocin in exploration, play, stress, and anxiety is still unknown. The present work addresses this literature gap by studying plasma hormone profiles for cortisol (CORT) and oxytocin (OT) of domestic dogs exposed to a novel arena containing two unfamiliar trainers who did not interact with the dogs. We provide evidence suggesting a functional relationship between hormonal measures of cortisol and oxytocin and adaptive behavior (play-soliciting and exploration) in freely behaving domestic dogs. We have taken into account several possible factors in our analyses and interpretations, from the nature and quality of the measurements to demographic factors to statistical robustness. Our results indicate that reduced CORT levels are associated with increments of both play-soliciting behavior frequency and exploratory behavior duration. Furthermore, taken together, our data and our simulations suggest a relationship between OT and the enactment of play-soliciting behaviors by freely behaving domestic dogs that must be further investigated. Future studies should consider naturalistic structured and semi-structured experimental approaches linking behavior with (neuro) physiological measures, taking into account demographic factors such as age and relevant interphase factors such as the sex of the dog; and socio-historic factors such as the playfulness of the dog, history of interaction with young humans, among others, to take full account of interaction between humans and animals in comparative studies (Parada and Rossi, 2018).","1559 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs,NA,NA

These dogs are highly trained to improve human welfare, yet not much is known about their own welfare. One of the ways in which welfare can be measured is through the expression of stress via the hormone cortisol. In this study, we investigated the level of cortisol in saliva, a measure for physiological stress, in 19 service dogs. We measured cortisol in the dogs‚Äô saliva 15 min after arrival at a training ground, before partaking in a training session for service dogs, after participation in the training session, and after a 45-min free play period. We found no elevated levels of cortisol after the training session. Instead, we found that cortisol had lowered when compared to before the training. Additionally, we found that cortisol was highest 15 min after arriving at the training round and after 45 min of free play. This led to the conclusion that dogs in our study did not seem to have a stress response in response to participation in the training.AbstractOnly a few studies have investigated the welfare of animals participating in animal-assisted interventions (AAIs). Most of these studies focus on dogs in therapeutic settings. There are, however, also dogs‚Äîservice dogs‚Äîthat are employed to continuously support a single human. Because the welfare of these service dogs is important for the sustainability of their role, the aim of this study was to investigate their stress response to service dog training sessions. To do this, we took repeated salivary cortisol samples from dogs who participated in a training session (n = 19). Samples were taken just after arrival at the training ground, before training, after training, and after a period of free play. Our results showed that mean cortisol levels in all samples were relatively low (between 1.55 ¬± 1.10 and 2.73 ¬± 1.47 nmol/L) compared to similar studies. Analysis further showed that samples taken before and after participation in the training‚Äôs session did not differ from one another. Mean cortisol levels in both situations were additionally lower than those upon arrival at the training site and after a period of free play. This led to the conclusion that the dogs in our study did not seem to experience training as stressful.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,"Dogs;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;Hydrocortisone",NA,NA

A non-invasive polysomnography method was used to collect data from pet dogs (n = 16) participating in 3-hour-long sleep occasions. Before sleep, dogs were exposed to emotionally positive or negative social interactions (PSI or NSI) in a within-subject design. PSI consisted of petting and ball play, while NSI was a mixture of separation, threatening approach and still face test. Sleep macrostructure was markedly different between pre-treatment conditions, with a shorter sleep latency after NSI and a redistribution of the time spent in the different sleep stages. Dogs' behaviour during pre-treatments was related to the macrostructural difference between the two occasions, and was further modulated by individual variability in personality. This result provides the first direct evidence that emotional stimuli affect subsequent sleep physiology in dogs.","20171883-20171883 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs,NA,NA

Ten female volunteers and their own male Labrador dogs participated in an experiment during which the owner stroked, petted, and talked with her dog during the first 3 minutes. Blood samples were collected from both dog and owner before (0) and at 1, 3, 5, 15, 30, and 60 minutes after the start of the interaction. Blood samples were analyzed by EIA.

The cortisol concentrations at P2 and the differences in concentrations between P1 and P2 (P2‚ÄìP1) in the groups with high sociability were significantly lower than those in the groups with low sociability. These results may demonstrate that sociable dogs adapt more comfortably to strangers and unfamiliar situations.

Across the next three sessions, we thinned the food schedule to a Fixed Interval (FI) 15-s, FI 1-min, and finally extinction. The fifth session reversed back to the original food contingency. We tested owned dogs in familiar (daycare) and unfamiliar (laboratory room) environments, and with their owner or a stranger as the person providing petting. In general, dogs preferred food to petting when food was readily available and all groups showed sensitivity to the thinning food schedule by decreasing their time allocation to food, although there were group and individual differences in the level of sensitivity. How dogs allocated their time with the petting alternative also varied.

One way to assess associations between specific behaviours and the perception of emotionally competent stimuli is to look at other reliable measures that are related to cognitive and physiological processing. Using a cross-modal preferential looking paradigm (Albuquerque et al., 2016), we presented dogs with pairs of facial expressions (positive and negative) combined with an emotionally charged vocalisation (positive or negative) or a control sound (neutral) and coded their mouth-licking behaviour. We found an effect of the valence of the face image dogs were seeing on the onset of the mouth-licking, with higher frequencies of this behaviour in response to the negative faces compared to images with positive valence. However, neither the sound being played nor the interaction between image valence and sound affected the behaviour. We also found an effect of species with mouth-licking occurring more often towards human stimuli.

We found that these dogs are capable of following distal pointing cues from humans to locate hidden food rewards. However, approximately half of the population tested showed a lack of tendency to participate even after successful familiarization with the experimental setup. A closer inspection revealed that anxious behavioral states of the individuals were responsible for such an outcome.

Potential buyers also prefer dogs which are held in complex as opposed to barren environments. This study examined the behaviour of sheltered dogs in response to environmental change, to determine whether it influenced dog behaviour in ways that could be perceived as desirable to potential dog buyers, and/or had any effect upon the incidence of dogs purchased from the shelter. One hundred and twenty dogs sheltered by the Ulster Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals were studied over a 4-h period. The dogs' position in the cage, vocalisation, and activity were investigated in response to increased human social stimulation, moving the dog's bed to the front of the cage, or suspending a toy from the front of the dog's cage. Social stimulation resulted in dogs spending more time at the front of the enclosure, more time standing, and slightly more time barking. Moving the bed to the front of the cage encouraged dogs to this position, but did not influence activity or vocalisation. Suspending a toy at the front of the pen exerted no effect on dog behaviour, although its presence in the pen may help to promote more positive perceptions of dog desirability.

The aim of this preliminary study was to assess the effects of early gentling and early environment on the emotional stability of puppies. Forty-three dogs (16 females and 27 males) from seven litters were used. Four of these litters (in total 23 puppies) were raised in a professional breeding kennel, while the remaining litters lived in their owner's home, in a family atmosphere. Half of every litter was gently handled daily from the 3rd day postpartum until the 21st. In order to assess the puppies' emotionality, an isolation test followed by an arena test were conducted on every puppy at the age of 8 weeks. Video recording of the tests allowed the measurement of each puppy's vocalization and exploratory activity. Data were analysed with the Newmann-Keuls' test comparing four groups: non-handled puppies raised in family (NHF); handled puppies raised in family (HF); non-handled puppies raised in a professional breeding kennel (NHB); handled puppies raised in a professional breeding kennel (HB). The results suggest that early environment strongly influences the emotional stability of puppies when put in isolation: latency to the first yelp was longer (p <0.05) in the HB group (89.46¬±66.42) compared to NHB (45.90¬±52.76), NHF (13.10¬±12.17) and HF (17.90¬±14.32), and in the NHB compared to NHF and HF; duration of vocalizations was shorter (p <0.05) in the HB (36.77¬±54.16) and NHB group (72.80¬±60.57) compared to NHF (149.78¬±19.52) and HF (132.50¬±45.24). Moreover, early gentling had a cumulative positive effect on the emotional development of puppies. For both environments, handled puppies were calmer. In fact, they showed longer latency to vocalize and handled puppies (HB=119.00¬±39.85; HF=97.12¬±33.56) spent significantly more time (seconds) in exploratory activity (p <0.05) compared to the corresponding non-handled puppies (NHB=64.90¬±34.06; NHF=57.00¬±26.61). Therefore, it is concluded that the deliberate inclusion of gentling during early puppyhood would be advantageous to the emotional development and welfare of the puppy, in particular for those at risk of limited or poor tactile stimulation in the early weeks.","p. 294-304 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,NA,NA,NA

Consistent with our previous findings, we obtained no overall effect of age on locomotion. We did find, however, that for the aged dogs locomotion correlated with level of cognitive function, being lowest in age-unimpaired dogs and highest in impaired dogs. Exploratory behavior, as measured by response to novelty, varied with age, with young dogs scoring the highest. Young dogs spent more time with novel toys and a person, responded more to a silhouette of a dog, and interacted more with a model dog compared to aged dogs. Among the aged dogs, age-unimpaired dogs spent the greatest amount of time sitting or standing beside a person whereas age-impaired dogs spent the most time reacting to a reflection in a mirror. The age-impaired dogs show undirected, stereotypical types of behavioral patterns. These differences in activity patterns may be linked to underlying age-associated neuropathology.","317-325 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs;Cognition,NA,NA

The main question is whether this behaviour is a result of instrumental learning or higher cognitive skills are required. The present investigations were undertaken to study the effect of learning processes upon the gaze towards the human's face as a communicative response. To such purpose, in Study 1, gaze response was subjected to three types of reinforcement schedules: differential reinforcement, reinforcer omission, and extinction in a situation of ""asking for food"". Results showed a significant increase in gaze duration in the differential reinforcement phase and a significant decrease in both the omission and extinction phases. These changes were quite rapid, since they occurred only after three training trials in each phase. Furthermore, extinction resulted in animal behaviour changes, such as an increase in the distance from the experimenter, the back position and lying behaviour. This is the first systematic evaluation of the behavioural changes caused by reward withdrawal (frustration) in dogs. In Study 2, the gaze response was studied in a situation where dogs walked along with their owners/trainers. These results show that learning plays an important role in this communicative response. The possible implications of these results for service dogs are discussed.","464-469 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs;Reinforcement (Psychology),NA,NA

We assessed stress for 754 students, 40 handlers, and 40 dog participants in a canine therapy stress-reduction program hosted on a university campus. There was an overall significant decrease in handler and student stress and an increase in canine stress when observations of stress measured at home were compared to end-of-session stress. No change in canine stress was found when start-of-session stress was compared with end-of-session stress. For handlers whose initial self-reported stress was elevated, a correspondingly higher level of canine stress was identified at the end of the session. This finding suggests an emotional contagion or spillover model of stress whereby handlers‚Äînot student clients‚Äînegatively contribute to the affective experience of working therapy dogs.","p. 6-13 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,NA,NA,NA

Here we explored its use for remote stress monitoring (i.e. removing need for human presence) in a sample of six pet dogs. Dogs were tested in a brief separation test involving contact with their owner, a stranger, and social isolation for two one-minute-periods. Tests were filmed using a thermographic camera set up in a corner of the room, around 7m from where the subjects spent most of the time. Temperature was measured from selected regions of both ear pinnae simultaneously. Temperatures of both ear pinnae showed a pattern of decrease during separation and increase when a person (either the owner or a stranger) was present, with no lateralized temperature differences between the two ears. Long distance thermographic measurement is a promising technique for non-invasive remote stress assessment, although there are some limitations related to dogs' hair structure over the ears, making it unsuitable for some subjects.","p. 86-91 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,"Dogs;Ear, Inner;Ear",NA,NA

Here we have tested the hypothesis that the frequency of such incidents can be reduced with a new strategy of using trained alert dogs that warn of impending violent outbursts. Dogs were positioned among patients in psychiatric wards. Analyses show that the dogs warned of impending aggressive outbursts, responding to signals from a specific patient out of a group of unfamiliar psychotic patients. Their alerts were not a response to stress as canine cortisol levels were not significantly changed. Visual glance was the preferred method used by young dogs to respond to patient. Until a similar electronic technology is developed, trained alert dogs can help caregivers to protect both the patient and those around them from injuries that may otherwise result from aggressive outbursts in psychiatric patients.","1-11 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs;Aggression,NA,NA

Longitudinal behavioural assessments offer an alternative. We modelled longitudinal observational data on shelter dog behaviour using the framework of behavioural reaction norms, partitioning variance into personality (i.e. inter-individual differences in behaviour), plasticity (i.e. inter-individual differences in average behaviour) and predictability (i.e. individual differences in residual intra-individual variation). We analysed data on interactions of 3263 dogs (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ19‚Äâ281) with unfamiliar people during their first month after arrival at the shelter. Accounting for personality, plasticity (linear and quadratic trends) and predictability improved the predictive accuracy of the analyses compared to models quantifying personality and/or plasticity only. While dogs were, on average, highly sociable with unfamiliar people and sociability increased over days since arrival, group averages were unrepresentative of all dogs and predictions made at the individual level entailed considerable uncertainty. Effects of demographic variables (e.g. age) on personality, plasticity and predictability were observed. Behavioural repeatability was higher one week after arrival compared to arrival day. Our results highlight the value of longitudinal assessments on shelter dogs and identify measures that could improve the predictive validity of behavioural assessments in shelters.","170618 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,Dogs,NA,NA

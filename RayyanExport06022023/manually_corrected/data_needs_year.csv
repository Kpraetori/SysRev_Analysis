Given the close bond that dogs have with humans, the purpose of this research was to evaluate, through an exploratory descriptive study, the presence of the Still-face effect in dogs. To this end, a group of Beagle dogs were exposed to three one-minute phases in which first, an unknown experimenter interacted actively and positively with each dog (Interaction). Then, suddenly, she interrupted the interaction and remained passive, with a non-expressive face and without speaking or petting the dog (Still-face). Finally, the experimenter reestablished the interaction (Reunion). Our results showed a decrease in affiliative behaviors in dogs during the Still-face phase according to changes in the human's behavior, a pattern similar to the one previously found in infants. Contrary to expectations, no stress-related behaviors were shown during that phase. A carry-over effect was also observed in the Reunion phase. This study provides information about the human-dog interaction and the effects of its disruption on dogs' behaviors.","0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",10.1080/10888705.2021.1923493,Still-face;dogs;affiliative behavior;gaze;CANIS-FAMILIARIS;INFANTS RESPONSE;BEHAVIOR;STRESS;COMMUNICATION;REINFORCEMENT;HUMANS;LUPUS;TASK;FMRI;Dogs;Pilot Projects,NA,NA

rayyan-875292855,Behavior of laboratory beagles: Assessment in a standardized behavior test using novel stimuli and situations,2016,1,1,Journal of veterinary behavior,1558-7878,11,NA,18-25,"Döring, Dorothea and Ossig, Andrea and Haberland, Barbara E. and Dobenecker, Britta and Helmut, Küchenhoff and Jörg, Schmidt and Erhard, Michael H. and Rüdiger, Hack",https://www.proquest.com/docview/2000238305?accountid=12753&bdid=17177&_bd=ELS%2FPAuydMPLOpD124FJyG8r9ZY%3D,NA,NA,NA,"Laboratory dogs should be sociable with humans and react in a relaxed way when confronted with new stimuli and situations. This is of particular advantage when dogs are used in animal experiments and for the handling of dogs and animal welfare, in general. We determined the reactions of laboratory dogs to different stimuli and manipulations and evaluated the dogs' behaviors to these in the context of housing condition, sex, age, and origin of the dogs. Ninety purpose bred, 1- to 10-year-old laboratory beagles of both sexes from 4 research facilities were subjected to: a new, standardized behavioral test including unfamiliar situations, varied and novel manipulations not routinely involved in physical examination as performed by an unfamiliar person, and novel optical and acoustic stimuli. An earlier article reported on these dogs' responses to approaches and physical examination by known and unknown people (Döring et al., 2014). Here, we concentrate on the effects of environmental stimuli and atypical manipulations. Videotape-based assessment and scoring of the dogs' behavior showed distinct patterns of reactions. Most dogs reacted with interest toward the unfamiliar test person and readily established contact. Many dogs reacted with uncertainty to the unfamiliar object and sound. Signals that may indicate conflict or distress (muzzle licking, paw lifting, and panting) were observed in some of the dogs in all facilities and in all parts of the test. Lowest body language scores indicated by anxious and/or “submissive” postures were observed when the dogs' muzzles were held shut or when the dogs were covered with a thin cloth.Characteristic housing conditions of the different facilities significantly affected several endpoints. Male dogs were significantly less fearful than females in several parameters and older and facility-bred dogs were significantly less fearful. Housing conditions, sex, age, and origin of the dogs markedly affected their behavior.","p. 18-25 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,NA,NA,NA
rayyan-875293601,Effects of early gentling and early environment on emotional development of puppies,2008,4,NA,Applied animal behaviour science,0168-1591,110,3,294-304,"Gazzano, Angelo and Mariti, Chiara and Notari, Lorella and Sighieri, Claudio and McBride, Elizabeth Anne",https://www.proquest.com/docview/48091480?accountid=12753&bdid=17177&_bd=m9%2BQSA2z3ZEWkmxP07ITneD8pxc%3D,NA,NA,NA,"In recent years much interest has been focused on early experiences and numerous studies have been carried out in order to understand their effects on the behaviour of adult animals. The aim of this preliminary study was to assess the effects of early gentling and early environment on the emotional stability of puppies. Forty-three dogs (16 females and 27 males) from seven litters were used. Four of these litters (in total 23 puppies) were raised in a professional breeding kennel, while the remaining litters lived in their owner's home, in a family atmosphere. Half of every litter was gently handled daily from the 3rd day postpartum until the 21st. In order to assess the puppies' emotionality, an isolation test followed by an arena test were conducted on every puppy at the age of 8 weeks. Video recording of the tests allowed the measurement of each puppy's vocalization and exploratory activity. Data were analysed with the Newmann-Keuls' test comparing four groups: non-handled puppies raised in family (NHF); handled puppies raised in family (HF); non-handled puppies raised in a professional breeding kennel (NHB); handled puppies raised in a professional breeding kennel (HB). The results suggest that early environment strongly influences the emotional stability of puppies when put in isolation: latency to the first yelp was longer (p <0.05) in the HB group (89.46±66.42) compared to NHB (45.90±52.76), NHF (13.10±12.17) and HF (17.90±14.32), and in the NHB compared to NHF and HF; duration of vocalizations was shorter (p <0.05) in the HB (36.77±54.16) and NHB group (72.80±60.57) compared to NHF (149.78±19.52) and HF (132.50±45.24). Moreover, early gentling had a cumulative positive effect on the emotional development of puppies. For both environments, handled puppies were calmer. In fact, they showed longer latency to vocalize and handled puppies (HB=119.00±39.85; HF=97.12±33.56) spent significantly more time (seconds) in exploratory activity (p <0.05) compared to the corresponding non-handled puppies (NHB=64.90±34.06; NHF=57.00±26.61). Therefore, it is concluded that the deliberate inclusion of gentling during early puppyhood would be advantageous to the emotional development and welfare of the puppy, in particular for those at risk of limited or poor tactile stimulation in the early weeks.","p. 294-304 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,NA,NA,NA

Observational assessments of therapy canine stress in an on-campus stress-reduction program,2019,7,1,Journal of veterinary behavior,1558-7878,32,NA,6-13,"Silas, Haley J. and Binfet, John-Tyler and Ford, Adam T.",https://www.proquest.com/docview/2286904657?accountid=12753&bdid=17177&_bd=P62mWP%2FuZzXWzjHM8SGp35e8MNY%3D,NA,NA,NA,"Therapy animals are an important and growing support for students on university campuses; however, the stress experienced by dogs working in such programs has rarely been assessed. We assessed stress for 754 students, 40 handlers, and 40 dog participants in a canine therapy stress-reduction program hosted on a university campus. There was an overall significant decrease in handler and student stress and an increase in canine stress when observations of stress measured at home were compared to end-of-session stress. No change in canine stress was found when start-of-session stress was compared with end-of-session stress. For handlers whose initial self-reported stress was elevated, a correspondingly higher level of canine stress was identified at the end of the session. This finding suggests an emotional contagion or spillover model of stress whereby handlers—not student clients—negatively contribute to the affective experience of working therapy dogs.","p. 6-13 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kelsey""=>""Included""}",NA,NA,NA,NA

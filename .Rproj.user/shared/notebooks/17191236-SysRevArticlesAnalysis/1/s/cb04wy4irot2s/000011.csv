"1","lowest :  During extinction a previously learned behavior stops being reinforced. In addition to the decrease in the rate of the instrumental response, it produces an aversive emotional state known as frustration. This state can be assimilated with the fear reactions that occur after aversive stimuli are introduced at both the physiological and behavioral levels. This study evaluated frustration reactions of domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) during a communicative situation involving interactions with a human. The task included the reinforcement and extinction of the gaze response toward the experimenter's face when the dogs tried to obtain inaccessible food. The dog's frustration reactions during extinction involved an increase in withdrawal and side orientation to the location of the human as well as lying down, ambulation, sniffing, and vocalizations compared with the last acquisition trial. These results are especially relevant for domestic dog training situations in which the extinction technique is commonly used to discourage undesirable behaviors.

Which type of interaction dogs prefer and which might produce the most social behavior from a dog has not been investigated. In the current study, we assessed how dogs allocated their responding in a concurrent choice between food and petting. Dogs received five 5-min sessions each. In Session 1, both food and petting were continuously delivered contingent on the dog being near the person providing the respective consequence. Across the next three sessions, we thinned the food schedule to a Fixed Interval (FI) 15-s, FI 1-min, and finally extinction. The fifth session reversed back to the original food contingency. We tested owned dogs in familiar (daycare) and unfamiliar (laboratory room) environments, and with their owner or a stranger as the person providing petting. In general, dogs preferred food to petting when food was readily available and all groups showed sensitivity to the thinning food schedule by decreasing their time allocation to food, although there were group and individual differences in the level of sensitivity. How dogs allocated their time with the petting alternative also varied. We found effects of context, familiarity of the person providing petting, and relative deprivation from social interaction on the amount of time dogs allocated to the petting alternative.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        15 adult German shepherd dogs were studied with a help of 7 tests on various behaviour patterns. The experimental animals were tested twice, before and after special object-oriented play exercises. The purpose of a three months’ training was to develop the dogs. retrieval and searching abilities as well as self-confidence in various situations. The results showed that the dogs, human-isolated in the juvenile period, were incapable of playing a joint object-oriented game with the man, and a real bond between the animals and their masters could not be established in adulthood. In strange situations, besides, those dogs expressed unconfident and ‘wild-like’ behaviour, which could not be beneficially influenced by training in adulthood. A group of the dogs that had had enough human contacts in the juvenile period was studied. Their retrieval, searching abilities and confident behaviour in strange situations significantly improved after purposeful and intensive play exercises. In addition, according to the obtained results, it was concluded that infancy and capability to play object-oriented games with the man was inherited (particularly in German shepherds). An expression of that kind of behaviour and character of the play, however, was dependent on socialisation in the juvenile period and intensive retrieval play exercises in adulthood. © 1999 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  A commercial anti-barking muzzle for dogs was tested during winter on Australian Kelpies at a commercial breeding kennel, to examine the effects of the device on dog behaviour and welfare. The trial involved 16 dogs (paired on sex and age); one dog per pair was allocated at random to the Muzzle Treatment (MT) and the other to the Control Treatment (CT) (not muzzled). The dogs were penned individually with pairs housed in adjacent pens. Muzzle Treatment dogs wore the anti-barking device for about 43 h. Muzzles were removed for about 30 min on day 2 of the treatment period while dogs were fed. The behavioural responses of dogs were recorded over 4 days, from before application of muzzles (pre-treatment) to 2 days after removal of the muzzles (post-treatment period). Saliva samples were collected at 2, 21 and 24 h post-muzzling to measure saliva cortisol concentrations. The initial response of dogs to wearing muzzles was to display submissive behaviour: tail held between the hind legs or down for the first few minutes only and head and tail down for the majority of time while wearing the muzzles, especially in the absence of humans. Activity level (2.3 versus 15.7% of observations), barking (0.1 versus 7.8%) and standing posture (8.3 versus 29.5%) by dogs were significantly reduced (P<0.05) while wearing the muzzles compared to non-muzzled controls. Even in response to stimulation from humans, dogs barked significantly less when muzzled compared to non-muzzled controls (0.5 versus 23.4% of observations, P<0.01). However, based on saliva cortisol concentrations there was no evidence of a physiological stress response to wearing the muzzles. After removal of the muzzles after 43 h of treatment, the dogs in the Muzzle compared to Control Treatment tended to stand more (P<0.06) during observation sessions over the next 2 days (48.3 versus 32.5% of observations). It was concluded that although dogs responded to wearing the muzzle by modifying their behaviour, including the display of submissive behaviour, and vocalisation, there was no indication that the dogs showed a stress response when wearing the muzzle. Further evaluation of anti-barking muzzles for dogs is recommended to test the ability of dogs to drink and pant while wearing the device during hot weather, to ensure they can effectively thermoregulate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            A dog’s aggressive behavior is influenced by external and internal factors, including its psychological profile. In this study, dogs’ and owners’ personalities and the owners’ attachment style to their dogs were identified and associated with owner-reported dog aggression towards humans and animals. Forty Slovenian owners participated with their dogs, of different breeds and aggression history, sorted into three groups (non-aggressive dogs, dogs aggressive towards humans, and dogs aggressive towards animals). The owners filled out three separate questionnaires that assessed dog aggression history towards different targets, owner’s personality and degree of insecure attachment styles to dogs; namely anxious and avoidant attachment. Dog personality was characterized using a standardized dog mentality assessment test, during which the dog was exposed to nine tasks, performed outside, and dogs were scored based on behaviors they exhibited. The results indicated that dogs which were aggressive towards humans were less sociable than non-aggressive dogs and this was associated with the higher neuroticism scores of their owners. We also found that dogs which were aggressive towards strangers had owners with lower scores for anxious attachment and that dogs which were aggressive towards owners had owners with higher scores for avoidant attachment. These results imply that the psychological profiles of both a dog and its owner influence dog aggression towards humans. © 2020 by the authors.

"1","highest: While dog owners ascribe different emotions to their pets, including jealousy, research on secondary emotions in nonhuman animals is very limited and, so far, only one study has investigated jealousy in dogs (Canis familiaris). This work explores jealousy in dogs one step further. We conducted two studies adapting a procedure devised to assess jealousy in human infants. In each study 36 adult dogs were exposed to a situation in which their owner and a stranger ignored them while directing positive attention towards three different objects: a book, a puppet and a fake dog (Study 1: furry; Study 2: plastic). Overall, the results of both studies do not provide evidence that the behavioral responses of our dogs were triggered by jealousy: we did not find a clear indication that the fake dogs were perceived as real social rivals, neither the furry nor the plastic one. Indeed, dogs exhibited a higher interest (i.e. look at, interact with) towards the fake dogs, but differences in the behavior towards the fake dog and the puppet only emerged in Study 2. In addition, many of the behaviors (protest, stress, attention seeking, aggression) that are considered distinctive features of jealousy were not expressed or were expressed to a limited extent, revealing that dogs did not actively try to regain their owner’s attention or interfere with the interaction between the owner and the faux rival. Finally, a differentiated response towards the attachment figure (the owner) and the unfamiliar person (the stranger) did not emerge. Differently from what reported in human infants, dogs’ behavior towards the attachment figure and the stranger interacting with the potential competitor (in this case, the fake dog) did not significantly differ: in both studies dogs paid attention to the owner and the stranger manipulating the fake dog to the same extent. In conclusion, we do not exclude that dogs could possess a rudimentary form of jealousy, but we suggest that research on this topic should require the use of a real social interloper (conspecific or human) and more naturalistic procedures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             While only a few studies have analysed training methods used on working dogs, a recent survey in 303 Belgian military handlers revealed the use of harsh training methods on military working dogs (MWD). The present work aims at analysing the training methods used on Belgian MWD and the behaviour of handlers to objectify the performances of the dog handlers teams (DH teams) and the welfare of the animals. A standardized evaluation, including obedience and protection work exercises, was conducted on DH teams (n=33). Every evaluation was done twice to assess the reliability of the observation methods. The behaviours of MWD and handlers were recorded on videotape and subsequently analysed. Results showed that handlers rewarded or punished their dogs intermittently. Stroking and patting the dogs were the most frequently used rewards. Pulling on the leash and hanging dogs by their collars were the most commonly used aversive stimuli. The team's performance was influenced by the training method and by the dog's concentration: (1) low-performance dogs received more aversive stimuli than high-performance dogs; (2) dog's distraction influenced the performance: distracted dogs performed less well. Handlers punished more and rewarded less at the second evaluation than at the first one. This suggests that handlers modified their usual behaviour at the first evaluation in view to present themselves in a positive light. During the second evaluation the dogs reacted to this higher frequency of aversive stimuli as they exhibited a lower posture after aversive stimuli. The authors cannot prove that the welfare of these dogs had been hampered, but there is an indication that it was under threat. Low team performances suggest that DH teams should train more regularly and undertake the usefulness of setting a new training system that would rely on: the use of more positive training methods, an increased training frequency, the elaboration of a course on training principles, and an improvement of dog handler relationship.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Working dogs are gaining popularity for their ability to learn and perform tasks entertaining their human companions. For this reason, dogs are often subjected to various stimuli due to inter- and intra-specific interactions, environmental variations and effort required by different activities. In the present study, salivary cortisol was measured to monitor physiological response to different conditions. The first study was performed to assess the variability of salivary cortisol in dogs in usual environmental conditions. For this, salivary cortisol was measured in 10 dogs at home during three not consecutive days at three different times of the day and not significant variations between days and time of sampling were observed. In the second study, salivary cortisol was measured in dogs before and after Pointing Hunting (No. 5), Tracking for Ungulate Hunting (No. 6), Blood Tracking (No. 4), Agility Training (No. 6) and Animal Assisted Activities (AAA, No. 6). Salivary cortisol concentration significantly increased after the Pointing Hunting activity (p <.05), while salivary cortisol significantly decreased at the end of AAA session (p <.05). No significant differences in cortisol variations were observed for Tracking for Ungulate Hunting, Blood Tracking and Agility Training, before and after the activities. The response of cortisol suggests that the extent of hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis activation varies between short high-intensity activities and endurance exercises. The measurement of salivary cortisol can support the trainers to evaluate the animal response to the stimulations. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Working dogs trained to be detection/sniffer dogs must work closely with their human partners. Pet dogs are also often asked to perform tasks, whether in a casual context (e.g., going for a walk) or as part of more formal activity (e.g., competitive sport). For the best performance outcomes, each partner must signal well to the other, and accurately read and respond to the other's signals. As part of a larger study comparing problem-solving behavior and information use in working dogs and pet dogs, we compared the detailed responses of 40 detection dogs and 80 pet dogs to verbal signals under two conditions: when the handler was facing the dog (front-facing condition) versus when the handler had his back to the dog, while giving a verbal request (back-facing condition). We hypothesize that: (1) both groups of dogs would be more accurate and faster in response when they could see the humans' faces and anterior bodies (front-facing condition) than in the back-facing condition; (2) dogs who did not respond immediately and correctly to the signal would exhibit behavioral signs of anxiety, uncertainty, and possibly distress, and such signals would be more common in the back-facing condition; and (3) the working dogs would be more consistent and successful as a group when compared to the pet dogs because working dogs have been specifically trained to do a job, in joint collaboration with humans who signal to them when and where to do the job and when they are successful. As such, clear signaling and response was already part of their practiced and tested daily life, and so should be reflected in their testing in this study. All testing was video recorded using the same test design and same order of tests. Neither pet nor working dogs were familiar with the test before initial testing, and neither was tested in a physical space that was familiar to them. Video analysis determined latency to response, time to completion of requested task, and identification of behaviors exhibited during the two conditions (human facing the dog/front-facing condition, or with the human's back turned to the dog/back-facing condition). Requests were given verbally using a normal tone of voice. Handlers were asked not to use hand signals. The three requests used were “sit,” “down,” and “stay”. For most comparisons, dogs were slower to respond and took longer to complete each request when they were unable to see the handler's face (back-facing condition) (all P < 0.05). The behaviors exhibited when the working dogs could not see their handler's face were largely associated with seeking further information that would allow the dog to comply with the request. This pattern of response suggests that improvements in signaling behavior and understanding for both team members can and should be made and should lead to improvements in the dogs' welfare and better team performance. Pet dogs exhibited both information-seeking behaviors and those associated with anxiety when they could not see their owner's face, suggesting that working on efficient and accurate exchange of cues and responses would improve pet dog welfare and help to create a trusting relationship where anxiety about collaborative tasks is minimized. YouTube videos of dog bites present an unexplored opportunity to observe dog bites directly. We recorded the context of bites, bite severity, victim and dog characteristics for 143 videos and for 56 videos we coded human and dog behaviour before the bite. Perceived bite severity was derived from visual aspects of the bite. Associations between bite severity and victim, dog and context characteristics were analysed using a Bayesian hierarchical regression model. Human and dog behaviour before the bite were summarised with descriptive statistics. No significant differences in bite severity were observed between contexts. Only age of the victim was predictive of bite severity: adults were bitten more severely than infants and infants more severely than children. Non-neutral codes describing dog body posture and some displacement and appeasement behaviours increased approximately 20 seconds before the bite and humans made more tactile contacts with dogs 21 seconds before the bite. This analysis can help to improve understanding of context in which bites occur and improve bite prevention by highlighting observable human and dog behaviours occurring before the bite.
